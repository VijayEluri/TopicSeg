I waved my hand to get the waiter's attention . 
Yes? 
The check, please. 
Would you like any dessert , or some tea or coffee? 
No, just the check. 
Thanks. 
Here you are. 
I'll ring that up for you when you're ready. 
Thank you. 
Oh, there seems to be a mistake on our bill. 
We didn't order this appetizer . 
Let me check this and I'll be right back. 
Here you are. 
I've adjusted the check. 
I took off the appetizer. 
Thanks, but there still seems to be a problem . 
We had a two-for-one coupon , but we've been charged for both meals. 
I'm sorry, but you needed to present the coupon to me when you placed your order , not when you've finished your meal. 
That isn't stated on the coupon. 
I don't want to be a pain , but could I see the manager, please? 
I'll see if she's available. 
I talked to the manager and she said to make an exception in this case and to give you the discount. 
Okay, thanks.
