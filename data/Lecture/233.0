I admit it. 
I'm a player . 
I work in an office where there are a lot of attractive women. 
Take Debra, for example. 
I heard that she just broke up with her boyfriend last week so I decided to ask her out. 
Hi, Debra. 
How's it going? 
Okay, I guess. 
How about you? 
I'm doing okay. 
You know, I'm going to an art show this Saturday. 
Would you like to come with me? 
Geez , I'm pretty busy this weekend. 
That's too bad. 
How about going for a drink after work today? 
Well, I don't know... 
Come on. 
It'll be fun and we can try that new place down the street. 
I guess that'll be okay, but just a drink, right? 
That's all and I promise I won't even try to buy you dinner . 
[laughs] Okay, then. 
I'll see you after work. 
I ask women out wherever I see them, even ones I've never met before. 
At a restaurant, if I see a woman eating by herself, I usually say: 
"I just hate eating alone. 
Do you mind if I join you?" 
The other day, I saw a woman at the grocery store and tried my luck . 
Hi. 
Hi. 
I've just moved to this area and was wondering if you could recommend a good restaurant around here. 
That depends on what kind of food you like. 
There's a good Italian restaurant on Elm Street, or there's a good Thai place on Lyndon Avenue. 
Which one do you prefer? 
I like them both, but I'd probably go for the Italian place. 
In that case, would you like to join me for dinner sometime? 
I'm not sure. 
I don't even know you. 
You're right, but you seem really nice and I'd like to get to know you better. 
What do you say? 
Well, maybe. 
Here's my number. 
Call me and we'll talk about it. 
I'll do that. 
I'm looking forward to talking with you again. 
It's as easy as that. 
I don't try to be a player. 
All it takes is a little charm and a little flattery , and women will find you irresistible .
