Can I help you? 
I'd like to buy some stamps. 
In what denomination? 
I'm not sure. 
I need them for sending regular letters and for Priority Mail. 
The current rate for sending a first-class letter is 41 cents. 
With first-class service, your letter will get there in three to seven days for domestic mail. 
For the first-class stamps, how many come in a book or a roll? 
There are 20 in a book and 100 in a roll. 
To send a Priority Mail envelope, you can get $4.05 stamps, and delivery is usually in two to three days. 
How many would you like of each? 
I'll take one book of the stamps and four Priority Mail stamps. 
Can I buy stamps to send an Express Mail envelope, too? 
You can. 
Those are $14.40 each. 
Could you add one of those, too? 
And how much is it to send a postcard? 
I don't need any stamps for those today, but I'm just curious. 
It's 24 cents to send a postcard. 
Okay, that's a book of 41-cent stamps, four Priority Mail stamps, and one Express Mail stamp. 
Anything else? 
Could I pick the design of the first-class stamps? 
Yes. 
You can choose from these commemorative ones or the standard flag design. 
I'll take the commemorative ones. 
Your total comes to $38.80. 
Here's $40. 
Here's your change and your stamps. 
Have a nice day. 
Thanks. 
You, too.
