Our episode is entitled "Going Out of Business," which describes what happens when a company decides to close its business.
Julianne begins by saying, "I'm really glad to be back in Macville.
What happened to the market that used to be here?"
Helio says, "Oh, it went belly up."
"To go belly (belly) up" is an expression that means to fail as a business ? to go out of business.
Helio says the business "struggled for many years."
"It struggled," it tried very hard to do something that was difficult.
"The owners tried to downsize and reduced the space they were renting."
"To downsize" means to reduce the size of your business.
It is often used to mean you are getting rid of some your employees ? you have a smaller company, you are "downsizing."
Well, this company downsized by reducing the amount of space it had to rent for its store, but eventually the company "had to throw in the towel when they got into debt."
The expression "to throw in the towel" is an idiom meaning to give up; to stop trying to do something because is too difficult: "I tried to learn how to play the piano when I was young, but it was too difficult for me so I threw in the towel."
In this case, the business has to throw in the towel because they are in debt (debt).
"Debt" is when you owe money to a bank, a company, or another person.
You borrow the money, then you are in debt to that person.
Notice we use the expression "to be in debt," means I have a lot of loans I have to pay.
So in this case, the company went into debt, or they got into debt, which meant they didn't have enough money to pay back the loans that they had taken out.
You can be in debt without closing your business, of course, as long as you are paying for your loans.
In the United States, there are many people who bought big houses over the last few years, and now are in debt and they have problems paying their loans.
Julianne says, "What a shame!"
That expression, "what a shame," means "what a pity."
It's used to show that you feel bad about something that has happened.
It can also be used to show sympathy to someone else.
"My girlfriend left me," and you say "What a shame!
Can I get her phone number?"
Helio says that "things have changed a lot around here."
Julianne asks, "Where is the restaurant that was next to the market?
I used to eat lunch there all the time."
Helio says, "The owners (of the restaurant) couldn't make it profitable."
When we say something is "profitable," we mean it's making money; it is getting more money in than it spends ? they are profitable.
Well, they could not make the business profitable, "and after trying to get loans to bail themselves out," Helio says the restaurant "ran out of options."
"To get a loan," as we talked about earlier, means you get money from a bank or from another person, with the understanding that you are going to pay that money back, you are going to give it back.
Usually, you give it back "plus interest," you give them money for loaning you the money.
The restaurant tried "to get loans to bail themselves out."
The expression "to bail (bail) one's self out" is to get out of a difficult situation, especially when you don't have enough money; to do something so that it is no longer a default financial situation for you.
For example, if a bank is having problems and it doesn't have enough money, in many countries the government will come in and bail the bank out ? they will get them out of this difficult financial situation.
Both the word "bail" and "shame" have additional meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.
Well, the company ? the restaurant tried to get loans to bail itself out, but "they ran out of options."
An "option" is a choice ? an alternative.
"To run out of something" means to no longer have something.
You can run out of milk: "I don't have any milk in my house, I ran out."
In this case, "to run out of options" means you don't have any other choices; you are forced to do one thing because there are no alternatives.
The restaurant "had to pack it in."
This is yet another expression meaning to stop doing a job or an activity.
You may say that at the end of the day at your work: "I'm going to pack it in" ?
I'm going to stop working.
In this case, the restaurant stopped operating completely.
Julianne says, "What's happening here?" meaning what is going on in this town of ours ? this city where we used to live.
Helio says, "The gift shop is going out of business.
It's having a big sale to liquidate the store."
When a company, especially a store, closes, it will often try to liquidate its products.
"To liquidate" means to sell everything that the business owns.
Usually because you need to pay back your debt ? you need to pay your loans, so you sell everything you have.
That is "to liquidate."
Helio says the owners of the gift shop lost their lease and had to close.
"To lose your lease" means that you can no longer rent the place where you were renting before.
A "lease" (lease) is a legal agreement to rent something; "to lose your lease" means you no longer are able to rent from whoever owns the property ? whoever owns the building.
They decided not to, we would say, "renew your lease."
"Renew" means to sign a new agreement.
Helio says the "store had been in the family for generations."
"Generations" means a long time, in this case.
A "generation" is a group of people who are born at about the same time.
We sometimes refer to every 15 to 20 years as a generation.
There's a famous book in the United States called The Greatest Generation, talking about the generation of Americans that fought in World War Two.
My father was one of those, in the "greatest generation."
Well, in this case the store had been in the family for generations ? for many years, "but the property owners want to tear down the building for a parking lot."
"To tear something down" is a phrasal verb meaning to, in this case, destroy something ? to get rid of something.
In the neighborhood where I live, there are many small houses, like mine, that have been torn down and new houses have been built on the same area ? the same land where the little house used to be.
Julianne says, "A parking lot?
For what?
With this economic downturn and all of these businesses going bankrupt, who will want to park there?"
She's saying that there's no need for a parking lot because there has been an economic downturn.
A "downturn" is when the economy gets worse.
People are losing their jobs, inflation may be going up, this is a "downturn."
"To go bankrupt" means that you legally declare to the government that you no longer have money to pay your debts.
Usually if you go bankrupt as a business, you have to close your business.
So, that is "bankruptcy."
I hope you don't go bankrupt any day soon!
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
