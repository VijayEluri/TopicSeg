I pushed the call button to get the attention of the flight attendant. 
Yes? What can I do for you? 
It's very cold in the cabin. 
Is it possible to get a blanket? 
We're out of blankets, but here's a pillow. 
Okay, thanks. 
I was asleep during the meal service. 
Could I get a meal? 
We don't have any more of the Baked Chicken. 
We only have the Bean Salad left. 
Oh, okay, I'll take that. 
Could I also get a drink? 
What would you like? 
What do you have? 
The complimentary drinks are listed in our in- flight magazine. 
Beer, wine, and other cocktails are $4. 
I'll have a diet soda. 
We're out of diet soda. 
How about just some water? 
What's that? 
That's turbulence. 
Make sure your seatbelt is fastened. 
Could I get an airsickness bag, please? 
I'm sorry, but we're out of those, too.
