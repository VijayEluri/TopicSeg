What are you watching? 
I'm watching a really interesting TV program. 
It's about how to make a lot of money quickly and easily. 
Are you watching an infomercial ? 
Those things are scams ! 
You should know better than to fall for some get-rich-quick scheme . 
This isn't a scam. 
This program is about how make money with no capital . 
All I have to do is to get other people to sell these products and I'll get a cut of the profits . 
That sounds like a pyramid scheme . 
Only a few people at the top make money, while all of the other people lose their shirts . 
It doesn't seem like a fraud to me. 
Sit down and watch for a minute and you'll see all of the testimonials from people who have used this system and who have struck it rich . 
It may really work. 
There's a sucker born every minute. 
How much do you have to pay to learn the secrets to this system? 
It's only $179.95, and I can pay in monthly installments . 
The program comes with a step-by-step book and video on how to get started. 
I think you're wasting your time . 
I can think of a lot of things I'd rather spend $179.95 on. 
That's your prerogative . 
Don't come to me later when I'm a millionaire and you want my business advice. 
Don't worry. 
That will never happen.
