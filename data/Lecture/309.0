Could you tell where I can find a drugstore? 
Sure. There's one up the street near the corner of Selma and Main. 
If you get to Abreu Avenue, you've gone too far. 
It's set back from the street so it's a little hard to find. 
Oh, that's okay. 
I'll keep an eye out for it. 
You know, I just remembered that there's a bigger and better drugstore around the block. 
It's no more than a three-minute walk. 
Go out the main doors of the hotel, hang a left, go straight for about a quarter of a mile, and then make another left at the first street. 
Okay. I think I've got that. Thanks. 
Now, if you want a drugstore with a pharmacy, you'll need to walk a little farther. 
Go out these doors, walk roughly three blocks until you get to a dead end, turn right, cross the street, and you'll see a bank. 
It's kitty-corner from the bank. 
You should be able to walk there in five minutes, give or take. 
Thanks. Thanks a lot. 
I think I'm all set. 
See you later. 
You know, I just remembered that there's another drugstore... 
Thanks, but I've really got to get going. Bye. 
Well, some people just don't appreciate other people's help!
