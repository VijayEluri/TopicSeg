Our dialogue begins with Sunny saying to Igor, "Did you hear the news (did you hear what happened)?
Nancy and Brian are splitting up."
"To spit up" is a twoword phrasal verb meaning to end a relationship, especially a romantic relationship.
The person who ends the relationship is usually the one who is described as "splitting up with."
For example "My girlfriend told me she was splitting up with me" ? she wanted to leave me; I didn't want to leave her.
That's the way it usually goes ? or went, when I was dating!
"To split up" has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.
Well, Sunny says that Nancy and Brian are splitting up.
Igor says, "How long have they been married?"
Sunny say, "Eight years.
I'm sure it was the sevenyear itch."
"To itch" is when you get a sensation on your skin that you need to scratch; that's an "itch" (itch).
"The seven-year itch" refers to an idea that is popular, at least in the United States, that people will become tired of their marriage after about seven years.
So, you get married, seven years later you decide, "Eh, maybe I'll find someone else."
That's the "seven-year itch."
It was also a movie, a very interesting movie.
Take a look at our Learning Guide in the cultural note, where we talk about this movie, The Seven Year Itch.
So, Sunny thinks that Brian and Nancy are splitting up because of the seven-year itch.
She then says what women often say when they find out two people are splitting up that they know, "I bet Brian was unfaithful to Nancy."
"To be unfaithful" means to be not loyal.
When you are talking about a romantic relationship, it means having another relationship with someone else who is not your wife, husband, girlfriend, or boyfriend.
So, if you are married, and then you start having a relationship, we would say "start seeing" another person, that would be "unfaithful."
Igor says, "How do you know?
Maybe it was Nancy who had a wandering eye."
A "wandering eye" means a tendency or typical behavior of "flirting," of trying to get other people interested in you romantically, who are not your wife, or husband, boyfriend, or girlfriend.
So when we say a man has a "wandering eye," that means he's in a relationship, but he's always trying to get the attention of other women.
Igor is saying that Nancy, the woman in this relationship, had the wandering eye.
Sunny says, "Maybe, but it's a shame" ? it's too bad.
When you feel sad about something, you may say, "It's a shame."
"They were such a nice couple.
Doesn't anyone take marriage vows seriously these days?"
Your "marriage vow" (vow) is a promise; your "marriage vows" are promises that a husband and wife makes to each other.
You can also use the word "vow" as a verb: "I vow I will make sure that I do the vacuuming tonight, dear."
"I vow" ?
I promise.
"Marriage vows," then, are promises between a husband and a wife.
When you have a marriage ? when you have a wedding ceremony, that's when you exchange these promises ? these "vows."
Sunny says, "To me, (marriage is) a lifelong commitment."
"Lifelong" (one word) means for your entire life, until you die.
A "commitment" is a promise to behave in a certain way, a promise to do something.
So, marriage is "a lifelong commitment."
Igor says, "If you ask me the (if you want my opinion), I think our notion of marriage is out of date."
"Notion" means idea or concept, a way of thinking about something.
Igor is saying that our notion of marriage is out of date.
"Out of date" means the same as old-fashion or outdated, something that doesn't belong to the present time.
Igor continues, "Conventional wisdom is that everybody wants to be unfaithful after they've been married a few years."
"Conventional wisdom" means common opinion, public opinion, ideas that are accepted by most people.
Something that is "conventional" is something that is typical; it's the way it's always been done.
"Conventional wisdom is that everybody wants to be unfaithful.
Why not make marriage a short-term arrangement?" he asks.
"Short-term" means for a short or limited period of time.
"In my view," Igor continues, and you know he's getting himself into problems by saying this, "a marriage should last for seven years unless you want to renew."
"To renew" means to continue to do something for a longer period.
If you become a member of ESL Podcast, you can "renew," you can, each month, continue your membership.
Well, Igor thinks that you should be able to renew your marriage.
"If you don't, you (should) each go your separate ways."
"To go your separate ways" means to end the relationship, especially a romantic relationship, so each person can do what they want to do ? not be married anymore.
Sunny, of course, doesn't agree.
She says, "You make marriage sound like an apartment contract!"
"Contract" is a legal, written usually, document between two people.
So, Sunny is saying you make marriage sound like it's just like any other agreement.
"Not everybody is as cynical as you."
"To be cynical" (cynical) means believing that bad things will happen, not believing anything good can happen.
You're being negative, pessimistic ? he's "cynical."
Sunny's saying that Igor is cynical about marriage.
She says, "I don't think that most couples think seriously about committing adultery, and many couples stay together for life."
"Adultery" (adultery) is when a married person has sexual relations with someone who isn't his wife, or her husband; that would be "adultery."
Not a good thing ? don't recommend it!
Igor says, "You may live in la-la land, but I live in the real world."
"La-la land" is an expression that means a place or time that is imaginary, that is silly, that it is not a serious way of looking at life.
You're saying to someone you are wrong, you are living in an imaginary world ? you're in "la-la land."
A lot of people describe Los Angeles this way ? of course, "la-la" is spelled LA (hyphen) LA!
Sunny says, "If that's the real world, I don't want to live there!"
Guess who will be sleeping on the couch tonight!
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
