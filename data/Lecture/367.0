Attention ! 
Aren't you supposed to salute ? 
You're not my superior officer . 
Stop goofing around . 
I'm busy. 
You're packing already? 
You don't need to report to duty for two days. 
Are you afraid they'll think you went AWOL ? 
I just want to be prepared. 
Now, leave me alone so I can finish packing. 
Am I dismissed ? 
Maybe I want to enlist , too? 
I think I would look good in camouflage make-up and fatigues . 
Being in the military is no laughing matter. 
Do you really think that the most desperate recruiter would want you? 
That's not very nice. 
I have as much discipline as you do...about some things. 
You may find yourself in a foxhole with me someday. 
Whatever deployment you'd get, I'd make sure I'm on the other side of the world!
