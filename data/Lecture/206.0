Belinda, maybe you can explain it to me. 
My parents still don't get me . 
I got a couple of tattoos and they freaked out . 
Why are you asking me? 
I may be a few years older than you are, but I don't understand parents any better than you do. 
They're hopelessly behind the times . 
I don't really expect them to keep up with what's going on right now or to know anything about what's in and what's out , but I thought they'd understand if I wanted to express myself . 
They were hippies in their day. 
Yeah, but being a hippie isn't the same thing as being a hipster . 
Most of them just don't keep up with pop culture . 
You know, now that I think about it, I'm not sure that's such a bad thing. 
What do you mean? 
Can you imagine going to the same clubs as your parents, or you and your parents reading the same blogs ? 
Oh, that would really suck . 
Okay, you've made your point . 
Things could be a lot worse.
