Good morning, I'm Dr. van Eyck. 
I understand that you're not feeling well. 
That's right, doctor. 
I've had a stomachache for three days. 
The pain comes and goes , but I also have heartburn and I am feeling bloated all the time. 
Well, let's take a look. 
Have you felt nauseous ? 
Does it hurt when I press here? 
Oh yes, that hurts, and I feel nauseous all the time. 
But, doctor, that's not all. 
I've also had bad headaches in the past week and I feel fatigued all the time. 
Have you had a stuffy nose , a cough, a sore throat , or an earache ? 
Yes, I've had all of those. 
You have? 
All of them? 
And, there's more. 
I've been feeling pains in my leg. 
Sometimes it feels stiff and sometimes I lose feeling in it. 
I'm having a lot of trouble walking. 
I have to say that you have an unusual combination of symptoms. 
Have there been any significant changes in your life in the past few days? 
Well, my in-laws are visiting from out of town. 
Do you think you'll need to admit me into the hospital for tests? 
I'm not sure that's necessary. 
Are things really that bad at home? 
You have no idea!
