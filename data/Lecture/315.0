I arrived at the park a little early for our neighborhood baseball game and I needed to kill some time. 
I decided to take a walk along one of the trails so I could look at the scenery. 
Suddenly, I came across a woman sitting under a tree. 
What a beautiful day to be at the park! 
Oh, hi. Yes, it's a nice day, isn't it? 
You look comfortable sitting on the grass in the shade reading. 
It's a quiet spot away from the playground. 
Do you come here often? 
Not too often. 
I come here every so often on the weekends. 
This is a great spot for a picnic. 
I saw a lot of people on the other side near the fountain, but this is much more peaceful. 
Yeah, that's why I like it here. 
Were you looking for the baseball field? 
It's on the other side of the park. 
Yes, I know. 
I was just warming up with a little walk around the park. 
We have a baseball game starting in a half hour. 
I saw some people practicing when I walked past the field earlier. 
I haven't seen a baseball game in ages. 
Why don't you come and watch? 
It should be a good game. 
Maybe I will. 
Thanks for the invitation. 
No problem. 
Take care. 
You, too.
