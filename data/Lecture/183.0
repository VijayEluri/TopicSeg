I went to the drugstore down the street to fill a prescription at the pharmacy. 
I've had some problems with my arm, and the doctor prescribed for me a new medication . 
I waited in line, and when it was my turn, I handed the prescription to the pharmacist . 
She told me to come back in fifteen minutes and she would have it ready for me. 
In the meantime, I went to look for some over-the-counter stomach medication. 
There were some in tablets and capsules . 
I decided on the capsules and returned to the pharmacy. 
The pharmacist asked me if I had taken this medication before. 
I told her I hadn't and she pointed out the directions on the bottle. 
It had the dosage information: 
Take two tablets two times a day. 
There was also a warning to not take it on an empty stomach . 
The bottle also said that I should stop taking the medication if I had any serious side effects . 
The pharmacist told me to follow the directions closely so that I can avoid an overdose . 
I paid for the medication and thanked her for her help.
