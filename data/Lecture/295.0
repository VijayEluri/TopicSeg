Check out this new game I just got! 
Let me see. 
Oh, it's a fighting game. 
I'm not into those. 
I like roleplaying or simulation games a lot better. 
This isn't just a fighting game. 
You have to use strategy for each mission . 
Check out these amazing graphics ! 
I can't play that at my house. 
I have a different console . 
Yes, you can. 
It's multiplatform . 
Look at the box. 
It says that you can use a joystick as your navigation system or a keyboard and mouse. 
You know, right now I'm really into retro games. 
You mean last year's games? 
No, I mean really old school games, like the ones my parents used to play. 
You mean like Pac-Man and Pong?! 
Yeah, exactly. 
They're classic and a lot less violent. 
Yeah, but they're so boring you fall asleep playing them. 
You can't call yourself a gamer if you play those kinds of games. 
Give me 3-D action and some blood and gore . 
You can have it. 
I'll pass .
