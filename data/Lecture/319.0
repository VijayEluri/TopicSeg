What's wrong? 
You look like you're in pain. 
My stomach is acting up again. 
It's all of this stress . 
I don't know how anyone can cope with the pressures you're under. 
It's nothing. 
I'll just take a pill for my stomach. 
That won't solve the problem. 
Look at you . 
You look worn out . 
Are you losing sleep , too? 
I have had trouble sleeping. 
It's no wonder . 
At home, you have the demands of raising two kids on your own, and at work, you're in a dog-eat-dog environment everyday. 
I have to admit that my nerves are shot , but what can I do? 
Maybe we can work something out . 
To start, how about if I watch your kids for a few hours this weekend so you can get some rest? 
I couldn't ask you to do that. 
You have to take care of your own kids. 
So, what's two more? 
If you really don't mind, I'll take you up on that . 
I could really use a breather . 
It's set, then. 
Here, take one of these pills. 
If it doesn't kill you, it'll make you stronger . 
Thanks!
