Hey, over here. 
I'm glad you could make it. 
This place has a great happy hour . 
Let me get the waitress, Brenda, so we can order our drinks. 
Hi, Gary. 
You sound like a regular . 
Do you come here a lot? 
Yeah, I like stopping by on my way home now and then to wind down . 
Is there another barstool ? 
Oh, sorry. 
Let me get another one for you. 
Have a seat . 
What will you have? 
I'll have a scotch , straight up . 
I usually don't drink very much. 
Alcohol sometimes doesn't agree with me. 
I've had a tough day, though, and I need to loosen up . 
Okay, one scotch coming up . 
Here comes the waitress. 
Okay, that's one scotch for Shanise and a draft beer for me. 
On second thought , bring a pitcher of the draft beer, would you? 
Thanks, Brenda. 
I'm starving. 
The sign outside says that they have all-you-can-eat appetizers during happy hour. 
Is that right? 
Right you are , and they have specials on everything on their menu. 
I don't usually go to happy hours, but I like this place. 
I'm glad you invited me to come. 
Would I steer you wrong ? 
Now let's get some grub .
