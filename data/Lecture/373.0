Hello, Torino's Restaurant. 
Hello, I'd like to place a delivery order . 
Can I have your address and the major cross streets , please? 
It's 1212 Main Street, and the nearest cross streets are Speedway and Highland. 
Okay, it looks like you're in our delivery area . 
What would you like to order? 
I'd like an order of spaghetti. 
Does that come with any sides ? 
You have a choice of soup or salad. 
I'll have the salad. 
Is that all? 
We have a $15 minimum for delivery orders. 
In that case , I'll also take an appetizer sampler plate . 
Okay, that's one order of spaghetti and an appetizer sampler plate. 
You're still $3 short . 
Would you like a drink or some dessert? 
I'll take an iced tea. 
All right, but you're still a dollar short. 
What can I get for a dollar? 
There's nothing on the menu for a dollar, ma'am . 
And you won't deliver my $14 order? 
That's our policy , ma'am. 
All right, you win. 
Give me an order of bread. 
How long will that take ? 
You should get your food in about an hour. 
An hour?!? 
Yes, ma'am. 
You've ordered a lot of food and it takes time for us to prepare it.
