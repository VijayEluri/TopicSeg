I wanted us to meet today to talk about ways to reduce our overhead. 
One suggestion is for us to outsource some of our operations. 
I'd like to hear what you think are the pros and cons of doing that. 
I think that, in principle , it's a good idea. 
It would save us a lot of money, but I see a downside. 
We would lose control of some of our key in house operations. 
Well, I think that we want to focus on non-core operations, such as IT or accounting. 
I know that other companies have outsourced their call centers , but that would take a lot of training, especially with our call volume. 
I completely agree. 
I don't think that the call center needs to be micro-managed, but it does take more oversight than IT or accounting for quality control, especially if we decide to go offshore. 
Okay, I think we're thinking along the same lines. 
Let's call a meeting with the rest of the staff to get their thoughts. 
How about next Tuesday at 10 a.m.? 
That works for me. 
I'll send out an email out to everybody today.
