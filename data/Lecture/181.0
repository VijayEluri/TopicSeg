What are you working on ? 
Oh, I'm writing the company profiles for the businesses participating in the meeting next month. 
Do you have a minute to give me some feedback ? 
Sure, what do you have so far ? 
I've started to write the ones for Landrun and Max Electronics. 
This is what I have for Lundrun so far: 
"A Fortune 500 company, Lundrun is a world leader in car manufacturing . 
Founded in 1936, Lundrun today is a $90 billion dollar company that sets a standard in the industry." 
That's pretty good. 
Don't forget to mention that their headquarters are in Chicago. 
Oh, yeah, I'll make sure I add that. 
Okay, here's what I have for Max Electronics: 
"Max Electronics is a Frankfurt- based company that has been a pioneer in the manufacturing of home electronics for over 75 years. 
The company has a global network of 1,500 distributors and has stores in 53 countries worldwide ." 
That's a good start. 
Why don't you pass them by me when you're done and I can give you some more feedback? 
Yeah, I'll do that. 
Thanks a lot.
