Our dialogue is between Antonio and Melanie.
They are going to a party ? they've been invited to someone's house for dinner ? and they want to bring a bottle of wine.
It's traditional if someone invites you to dinner at their house to bring a bottle of wine or some small gift for them.
Antonio begins by asking Melanie, "Why are we stopping here?" ? why are we parking our car and stopping at this place?
Melanie says, "We can't go to the dinner party empty-handed."
To be "empty-handed" means not to have anything, to come with no gift, with nothing.
Melanie says, "We need to bring a bottle of wine."
"Wine," of course, is an alcoholic drink that is made from a fermented ? a specially processed type of grape juice.
Wine is a popular drink at dinner in many countries, in Europe, in the U.S., and other parts of the world.
I am not actually a wine drinker.
I like the taste of wine, but it often gives me a headache.
So, I think my body is telling me that I don't need wine to talk or to be a little crazy; I'm crazy enough!
So, I don't drink wine myself, but it is very popular, and in our dialogue, Antonio says he doesn't know anything about wines ? he's just like me!
Melanie says, "I don't know much about wines, either.
I just know we need a good table wine."
A "table wine" is an inexpensive ? a not expensive type of wine that you drink with your meal.
It's not for special occasions; it's the common wine that you would find in a restaurant.
Not the best wine, but still probably, we hope, a good wine.
Melanie says to Antonio, "Do you think we need a bottle of white, red, or ros??"
These are three types of wine.
A "white" wine has a very light yellow color that you can see through easily.
A "red" wine, you can guess, has a dark red or purple color.
A "ros?" is a type of wine that has a light pink or purple color; you can usually see through, in the glass, a ros? wine.
Melanie says that the label on one bottle that she's looking at says that it's "fruity and not too tart."
The "label" (label) is the piece of paper that is, in this case, glued to the bottle of wine that gives you more information about it.
A "label" is any piece of paper ? anything that is put on something else to give you more information about it.
When you buy milk, for example, there's a label on the back that tells you how many calories and how much fat and other nutritional information.
This is a label that is telling Melanie what kind of wine this is.
For some additional definitions of this word "label," take a look at our Learning Guide.
Melanie says that the label says that this wine is "fruity and not too tart."
There are different ways that people sometimes describe the taste of wine; one way is to say that it is "fruity" (fruity).
Something is "fruity" when it has when it has a fruit-like flavor; it tastes or smells of many kinds of fruits or a particular kind of fruit.
If a wine is "tart" (tart), we mean it's sour .
"Sour" is the opposite of "sweet."
So, a "tart" wine is a sour wine; often, for some people, not good tasting, but some people like that kind of taste.
Melanie says the other bottle she's looking at is "full-bodied."
When we talk about a "full-" or "light-bodied" wine, we're talking about having a very strong taste if it's "full-bodied."
If it's "light-bodied," it would have a weaker taste or smell.
If ESL Podcast were a wine, I would describe it as "full-bodied" ? a strong taste!
Back to our dialogue: Melanie says that she thinks they want a light-bodied wine.
Antonio says, "I have no idea" ?
I don't know.
Melanie continues, "The label on this one (she's obviously picked up another bottle of wine ? a different bottle) says that it's from a California vineyard."
A "vineyard" (vineyard ? it's spelled like "vine-yard" but pronounced "vin-yard") is a farm where grapes are grown, usually for wine.
The grapes grow on a plant, and a plant is called a "vine."
Wine is made in many different parts of the world.
Italy and France and Germany, Spain are all famous for their wines, but there are other countries, also, that make good wines.
Here in the United States, California has a large wine producing section.
It's up in Northern California, north of San Francisco.
There was a popular movie a few years ago called Sideways in English, and it was, in part, about people going and visiting the wine areas in Northern California.
I, of course, have never been there, because I don't drink wine!
Melanie says, "Is this good or bad?" ? being from a California vineyard, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Antonio says, "I don't know.
Stop asking me."
Then he makes a joke, he says, "Here's a corkscrew.
Why don't you take out the cork and we'll have a taste?"
A "corkscrew" (corkscrew ? one word) is the tool you use to open a bottle of wine.
It usually has a piece of metal that goes into the top of the wine bottle; the wine bottle, on the top, has something called a "cork."
The cork is like the cap; it keeps the wine in the bottle.
So, a corkscrew takes the cork out.
Antonio is joking here, saying well, let's just taste the wine here in the store, which, of course, you normally cannot do.
Well, you could do it, but you'd have to buy the bottles of wine first!
Melanie says, "That's very funny."
The expression "that's very funny," said in that intonation ? said in that tone ? is meant to give you the idea that it's not funny ?
"I don't think that's funny."
It's a strange expression; someone makes a joke about you and you say, "Oh, that's very funny," you mean you don't think it's funny.
Antonio says, "I say we just bring them a six-pack."
A "six-pack" refers to six cans, usually, of beer or some other sort of liquid, usually beer.
Someone says, "I'm going to go get a six-pack," they mean they're going to go buy six cans of beer.
Usually the cans come together in a plastic-like container that holds them together.
A "six-pack" would be something you would buy for going to, say, a party with your male friends, watching the football game or the soccer game.
It's not something that you would bring to a dinner party.
Once again, Antonio is sort of joking, but he says, "I know I'd rather have beer than wine any day."
He's saying, "I would rather have beer," which is made from a grain; it is a popular alcoholic drink.
He would rather have a beer than a wine any day, meaning "I would always prefer a beer over a wine."
Melanie says, "Stop fooling around (stop joking).
We need to pick out a bottle of wine."
Antonio says, "Let's bring them a bottle of champagne."
"Champagne" is a type of white wine with bubbles in it that people usually drink on very special occasions.
True champagne comes from the area in France, that is the real champagne, but many companies now make champagne, and call it champagne.
It's a type of bubbly wine.
Antonio says, "You can't go wrong with champagne."
The expression "you can't go wrong" means you will never have a problem if you decide to use this particular thing.
Melanie says, "Champagne?
It's not a special occasion," or special event ? special happening, like a wedding or a holiday or a birthday; it's just a normal dinner party.
Antonio says, "We'll tell them that being invited for dinner (to their house) is a special occasion for us."
Melanie's not sure if this is a good idea, but Antonio says, "Trust me (meaning "believe me").
Grab a bottle (meaning "pick up a bottle") and let's go.
We're late!"
Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time at a normal speed.
