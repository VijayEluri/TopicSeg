Hello. 
Hi, could I speak to Natalie? 
This is she. 
Oh hi, this is Sergio. 
How are you? 
Good. 
How about you ? 
I'm great. 
Uh, well, the reason I'm calling is I was wondering if you'd like to go out sometime? 
You mean on a date? 
Yeah, with me. 
I'd love to. 
Really? 
I mean, that's great. 
I was thinking we could grab dinner on Friday and then see a movie. 
How does that sound ? 
Oh, I already have plans for Friday. 
How about Saturday? 
I'm tied up on Saturday, too. 
I'm free tomorrow, though. 
I don't suppose you want to go out tomorrow night? 
Sure, I can make it tomorrow. 
I'll pick you up around 7:00. 
Is that okay? 
Yeah, that works for me. 
See you tomorrow at 7:00. 
I'm really looking forward to it. 
Me, too.
