Our dialogue is called "Giving First Aid."
"First aid" is medical help that someone, who is usually not a doctor, gives to another person.
In the dialogue, Jeng asks Cynthia, "What did you do this summer?"
Cynthia says, "I worked at a summer camp as a nurse's aide."
A "summer camp" would be a place where you send children, usually for a week or two weeks.
Often, it is in a big park or next to a lake, and they haves games and other types of activities for the children.
Normally these happen during the summertime when children are not in school.
I went to a camp when I was 12 years old.
It was for one week, and I absolutely hated it!
I think it was the worst experience of my life ? one of the worst.
It was not very comfortable; you had to sleep in a big room with 20 other boys.
I don't really like going out into the forest or on the lake so it wasn't a good experience for me, but some children really like it.
A "nurse's aide" (aide) is an assistant, a person who helps a nurse.
A "nurse" is a medical professional who helps a doctor, but isn't as highly educated as a doctor.
Nurses work with the doctors, so a "nurse's aide" is someone who's helping the nurse.
Cynthia says, "I thought we would be giving simple first aid, but you wouldn't believe the kinds of injuries the kids came in with."
"You wouldn't believe" means it was quite unusual, something that you wouldn't expect: "You wouldn't believe the kinds of injuries."
An "injury" (injury) is damage or harm that is done to someone's body.
For example, you break your leg, that's an injury.
Cynthia is talking about the injuries that the children had at the summer camp.
Jeng then lists some common problems that you may have in a camp.
He says, "You mean like poison ivy, bee stings, bug bites, and scraped knees?"
"Poison ivy" (two words) is a kind of plant that when you touch it, makes your skin itch.
A "bee sting" is when a bee, which is a small insect that is often yellow and black and makes what we would call a "buzzing" sound, [Jeff makes a buzzing sound] that would be a bee (bee).
A "bee sting" is when the bee attacks you ? makes a small hole in your skin that often hurts, that's a bee sting.
A "bug bite" is also when an insect, what we would call often simply a "bug," comes and bites you ? makes a hole in your skin, so that your skin becomes red and it's itchy, and it often hurts.
A "scraped knee" is when your knee, which is part of your leg, has some of the skin taken off.
If you, for example, fall on the ground and you hit your knee, you may scrape it.
Some of the skin may off and you may begin to bleed ? to have blood come out of your knee; that would be a scraped knee.
The verb "to scrape" (scrape) means to remove the top layer or top part of something.
So, Jeng is saying did you have these common problems of poison ivy, bee stings, bug bites, and scraped knees; the kinds of problems you would expect children to have at a summer camp.
Cynthia says, "Yeah, we had those, but we had some pretty serious cases.
For instance (for example), the second day of the camp, one of the boys who didn't know how to swim fell into the lake."
To "fall into" means to go into, but usually by accident ? you didn't want to.
So, this boy doesn't know how to swim and he fell into the water.
"He must have hit his head," Cynthia says, meaning it is very likely that he hit the top of his head, "because he was unconscious when they brought him in."
So he went into the water, he hit his head, and then he was unconscious.
To be "unconscious" means you are not aware of what is happening around you, usually because you are hurt.
So, if you hit your head you may become unconscious.
It's like you're sleeping, almost.
Cynthia says that they could not find the boy's pulse.
Your "pulse" (pulse) is the same as your heartbeat.
It's the speed and strength of the blood moving through your body, and at certain points of your body you can feel that movement and we call that the "pulse."
So they couldn't find the boy's pulse; the nurse then did CPR.
"CPR" are initials that stand for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
"Cardio" relates to your heart; "pulmonary" relates to your lungs ? your ability to breathe in and out; "resuscitation" means to revive someone, someone who is not breathing ? make them breathe again.
So cardiopulmonary resuscitation is called, for short, "CPR."Many people, especially nurses and teachers and others who work with children, have CPR training.
They go to a day or two days where a nurse explains to them how to help someone who has stopped breathing.
CPR usually involves blowing air into the person's mouth and pushing on his or her chest, over the heart, with your hands to get the heart moving again ? to get the heart working again.
So in the story, the nurse performs, or does, CPR on the boy ? you do CPR "on" someone.
"Luckily," she says, "we got him breathing again right away (immediately), but that little boy had a concussion."
To "breathe" means to move air in and out of your lungs, [Jeff makes a breathing sound] that's breathing.
A "concussion" is when you lose consciousness because you are hit on your head.
This can be very dangerous, to have a concussion when you get hit very hard on your head
Jeng says to Cynthia, "Wow!
You're kidding.
That's serious."
Note when he says "You're kidding," he doesn't really mean "you are joking," which is what we would normally mean when we say "you're kidding."
"You're kidding" here is when you are surprised at something, when you can't believe something because it is so usual.
So, Jeng says, "You're kidding," meaning "Wow, that's unusual.
"
Cynthia says, "That wasn't all," meaning there was more that happened.
"It's true," she says, "that most of the kids came in with superficial scrapes, but some of them had some major wounds."
"Superficial" means on the surface, not very serious usually.
A "scrape," we know, comes from the verb "to scrape," when part of the skin is removed and the person starts to bleed.
To "bleed" means to have blood coming out of your body.
A "wound" (wound) is another word for an injury .
Often when blood is coming out of your body, on your arm or on your leg or on your head, we would call that a "wound."
Cynthia says, "the kids came in with superficial scrapes, but some of them had some major (or serious) wounds."
She says, "We had to stop the bleeding and bandage them up."
"To bandage (bandage) someone up" is a phrase that means to put cloth on someone's injury ? someone's wound ? so that it stops bleeding ? to put something on the skin so that it doesn't bleed, so that no more blood comes out.
Cynthia said, "We had one girl who needed 12 stitches after she fell out of a tree."
A "stitch" is a small line of thread that a doctor uses to put two pieces of skin together ? to sew two pieces of skin.
So if you cut your arm, for example, the doctor may put some of this string ? this thread ? in your skin to keep the skin together so that the wound can heal (heal).
To "heal" means to get better.
We would say you had to "get stitches": "I had to get stitches on my arm because I had a wound and I wanted it to heal."
Finally, Jeng says, "Geez (or wow), I never knew going to camp could be so hazardous to your health!"
Something that is "hazardous to your health" is something that is dangerous, something that is not safe: "Driving and trying to talk on your cell phone can be very hazardous."
Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time at a normal speed.
