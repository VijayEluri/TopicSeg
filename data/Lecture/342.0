What can I get for you? 
I'd like a pound of ground beef , please. 
Would you like the regular or the extra lean ? 
The extra lean is a dollar more per pound. 
I'll take the regular. 
Could you also throw in two thick pork chops and two chicken breasts? 
I'm sorry, but we're out of chicken breasts right now, but we have some thighs . 
Hmm... In that case , I'll just take some ham . 
I'd like that thinly sliced . 
Okay, is there anything else? 
Yes, I'd like some other cold cuts , but I'm not sure which ones. 
Why don't you give me half a pound of salami and a pound of bologna ? 
No problem. 
Will that be all? 
No, I'd like two steaks . 
Do you have any that are very, very tender ? 
The ones I bought last week were really tough . 
We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks. 
The rib eye is probably the most tender. 
I'll take two of those. 
Okay, anything else? 
No, I think that's all...for now.
