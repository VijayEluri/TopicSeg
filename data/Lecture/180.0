I was going to see a friend of mine in Oklahoma City and decided to use my frequent flyer miles . 
I booked a flight, but the only one they had had a long layover in Denver. 
I had three hours to kill and I decided to get something to eat at the food court . 
Unfortunately, I didn't check my bags and had my roller bag and carry-on with me. 
I lugged them with me, but when I got to the food court, all of the tables were taken . 
Do you want to share my table? 
Oh, uh, thanks, that would be great. 
It's packed in here. 
Yeah, it's always like this on Friday afternoons. 
You must travel a lot. 
Yeah, it's part of my job. 
It looks like you've got a lot of stuff with you. 
Do you want me to keep an eye on it while you get your food? 
Thanks, but I think I'll take it with me. 
But, if you could save this seat for me, that would be great. 
Sure, you got it .
