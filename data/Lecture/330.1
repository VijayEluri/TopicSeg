Our dialogue begin with Samantha saying to the employee, we would probably call them the "agent," who works for the bus company, "Good morning.
I had a few questions about buying a bus ticket.
Do I need to buy one in advance?"
When we say you buy something "in advance," we mean ahead of time, before something actually happens.
"The dentist is always very busy, so we need to make our appointments at least four weeks in advance" ? before the time of the actual appointment.
You can't just wait and do it on the same day.
So, Samantha is asking if she needs to buy a bus ticket in advance ? a day, or a week, or sometime before the day that she is going to travel.
The agent says, "You can, but it's not necessary (you don't need to).
You just need to arrive at the terminal at least an hour before the scheduled departure time to buy your ticket."
The agent is telling Samantha she needs to arrive at the "terminal," which is another word for the station ? the large building where buses or trains stop to let people off in a town, and let people get on the bus or the train.
We also use that word "terminal" in an airport; the different parts of the airport are called the "terminal."
Some airports have just one terminal; big airports, like here in Los Angeles, we have eight.
The agent says, "Boarding begins about 15 to 30 minutes before departure."
"To board" means to get on a bus, or to get on a plane, or to get on a train.
"Boarding," then, is the verb for getting onto a bus, train, plane, or perhaps a boat.
So, the agent says she can buy the tickets on the same day as long as she buys them at least one hour before the time that the bus leaves ? the departure time.
"Departure" is when the bus or plane leaves, "arrival" is when it comes to or arrives at a place.
Samantha says, "Can I reserve a seat?"
"To reserve" means to make arrangements for something in advance for you to use.
You're asking if you can have a seat assigned to you ? given to you ? so that when you get on the bus you know where your seat is, you're going to sit in a specific seat.
So, she wants to reserve a seat.
The agent says, "No (that's not possible), seating is on a firstcome, first-serve basis."
"Seating (or deciding where you're going to sit) is on a first-come, first-serve basis."
That expression, "first-come," means whoever gets there first.
"First-serve" means you get to do what you want ? you get to, in this case, select your seat.
So, the first people who get there are the ones who get to select their seats, and as new people arrive, they can select any seat that hasn't been taken.
We use that expression a lot: "It's first-come, first-serve," that means there are no possibilities of reserving a seat ? you can't ask for a specific seat.
Most airplanes, for example, have reservations, and you can reserve a seat.
There are some airlines, such as Southwest Airlines here in California and other states, where it is first-come, first-serve; whoever is in the line first gets to pick the seat first.
The agent says, "I recommend getting to the terminal early during peak hours."
"Peak" (peak) means very busy, when something is being used the most.
So, the "peak times" would be the busiest times of, in this case, the terminal where the buses are.
The agent says, "getting a good seat isn't usually a problem with the night service buses."
"Night service," you can guess, are buses that go at night, versus during the day.
I should mention the word "peak" has a couple of different meanings in English; you know what to do, take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Samantha says, "I want to go from Charlestown (Charlestown, South Carolina, in the southeast part of the United States), to Myrtle Beach (which is also located in South Carolina).
Do you know how many stops the bus will be making?"
A "stop," as a noun, is the place where a bus or a train stops for a short time before going on to another place.
So for example, if you're taking a bus between New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, the bus might stop at some cities in between to pick up new passengers, or to let some passengers leave who don't want to go to Boston, who want to go to some city in between Boston and New York.
If you have a bus that doesn't stop, that goes directly from one city to another, we would call that a "nonstop."
If it makes just a couple of stops, or very few stops, you could also call it an "express" bus (express).
So, Samantha is asking how many stops the bus will make.
The agent says, "I think it makes six stops to pick up passengers en route."
"En route" (en route - two words) means on the way, in between one place and another.
So, in between Charlestown and Myrtle Beach there are six stops.
The agent tells her she can "check the schedule to be sure.
That doesn't include rest stops and meal stops."
A "rest stop" is when you stop after traveling for a long time to let people get out of the bus, stretch their legs, walk around, use a restroom, that sort of thing.
A "meal stop" would be a place where you would stop and pick up a meal ? something to eat.
The agent says, "If you want to make fewer stops, you can buy a ticket for one of our express buses."
That word "express" has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional definitions.
Samantha then asks, "How many bags can I bring on board?"
"On board," means on the bus or on the train ? things that you carry with you, bags that you are taking to the place where you are going.
The agent says, "You are allowed two bags (two pieces of luggage).
The handler can help you load them upon boarding."
The "handler" (handler) is the person that carries, in this case, heavy luggage ? helps people put them onto the bus or the train.
"The handler can help you load" the luggage; "to load," in this case, means to put many things onto the bus, or in the back of a car, or on a train.
So, the handler will carry and put the luggage on the bus when you board, or "upon boarding," when you get on the bus, "but you are responsible for retrieving them when you get off" the bus.
"To retrieve" means to get something back from where it has been kept or stored, to pick something up that belongs to you that was being kept in a different place, in this case, below the bus, or on the bottom or back of the bus.
"Can I help you with anything else?" the agent asks.
Samantha says, "No, thanks."
The agent says, "Thank you for calling" ? she calls on the telephone ?
"Thank you for calling and have a safe trip."
The expression "have a safe trip" is a polite way of saying "have a good trip."
"Have a safe trip" ? have a nice trip.
In French, you may say, and we use this expression in English, "bon voyage" ? have a good trip, have a safe trip.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
