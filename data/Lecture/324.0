I don't know how we're going to keep our free sports program going without more funding . 
As it is, we're strapped and I don't know how we're going to continue. 
I know you've been resistant in the past, but what about corporate sponsorship ? 
I'm sure we can find some businesses that want to support us. 
I know you're trying to help, but I'm not willing to sell out . 
It's not selling out to have sponsors . 
Some businesses really want to keep public programs like ours free and available to the public. 
Being a benefactor is their way of helping us do that. 
In exchange, those companies get more exposure and enhance their public image . 
It's a win-win for everyone. 
Don't get me wrong 
I'm not trying to get on a high horse about sponsorship, but I don't want product placement , business signage , and outright advertising at our games. 
It sends the wrong message to the kids in the program. 
I don't think it's an all-or-nothing idea. 
You can limit the kinds of sponsorship you accept. 
Just don't throw out the baby with the bath water . 
You know, it may be our only option. 
Okay, okay. 
I'll look into it. 
You may be right. 
If it's a choice between canceling our programs and getting sponsorship, then I may have to live with it. 
Good. 
Let's keep an open mind and I'm sure we'll find something that will work.
