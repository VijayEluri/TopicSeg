My buddy from college, Jack, was getting married and our friend Rob was planning a bachelor party for him in Vegas . 
It was going to be the last weekend of the month and I wanted to go. 
The trouble was , I was scheduled to work that weekend. 
I needed to get the time off from work or I was going to miss out on all the fun. 
I have some vacation leave , but company policy requires that my boss sign off on any leave we take. 
I've heard of companies doing that for longer periods of leave - like maternity leave or a leave of absence - but our company does that even for vacation leave. 
I thought about just calling in sick that weekend - I do have a lot of accumulated sick leave - but I didn't think my boss would appreciate me leaving him hanging . 
In the end I just asked him straight out and to my surprise he said, "okay." 
Now, I just need to get ready for a wild weekend with the guys . 
I can't wait.
