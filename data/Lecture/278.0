I don't mind telling you that I'm really nervous about meeting your parents. 
You look like you're about to face the firing squad . 
It's not going to be that bad. 
I wish I could believe that. 
I'm going to try to make a good first impression , but I don't think they're going to like the fact that I'm a professional musician. 
I've already told them about you, so there won't be any surprises. 
It doesn't help that your last boyfriend was a straight-laced college student. 
Couldn't you have dated a convict before me? 
I'd look pretty good to your parents in comparison . 
How do you know I didn't? 
You don't know everything about me. 
Very funny. 
Maybe we should postpone this visit with your parents for a little while. 
No! 
I'm just putting it out there . 
We've put off this visit for months and my parents are really starting to wonder if you really exist. 
Let's not blow this visit out of proportion. 
They're only my parents. 
I know, but they may also be my in-laws soon. 
I know, but it's not like our whole relationship is riding on this visit. 
I'll still like you no matter what . 
And plus, my parents know that I have good taste in men. 
At least I know that's true!
