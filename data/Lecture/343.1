Fabian begins by saying, "Oh, your babies are adorable."
"Adorable" means very pretty, very cute, very attractive.
We often use that adjective when you are talking about babies ? young children, or perhaps small animals.
You may say to someone, "Oh, your 800 pound gorilla is so adorable!"
Fabian says the babies are "like two peas in a pod."
The expression "two peas (peas) in a pod (pod)" means they're almost identical, they're very similar, they're like twins.
"Two peas in a pod," used to describe two people who are very alike, very similar.
A "pea" is a small, green vegetable that you eat.
Peas grow in what are called "peapods," which are small, you can think of them as little packs ? little containers, where the pea itself grows.
Clarissa says my babies "may look like mirror images of each other, but they're nothing alike."
When we say something is a "mirror image," we mean it's identical; very similar in appearance, just like twins.
Me and the actor Johnny Depp, for example, are mirror images ? really!
Clarissa says her babies are "nothing alike," meaning they're not at all the same ? they're not at all alike, they're completely different.
You could say, "My brother and I are nothing alike, he's completely different than I am."
Clarissa says each of her babies has "their distinct personalities."
Something that is "distinct" is easy to distinguish, easy to tell the difference.
"Randy (one of her babies), likes to sleep during the day and Dominic (her other baby) likes to sleep at night."
Fabian says, "That's like my babies at home.
They're polar opposites."
When we say something is "opposite," we mean it's completely different; it's not alike.
The word "polar" opposites means they're extreme opposites; they have no similarities, they're very different ? they're "polar" opposites.
Fabian's babies "don't like eating the same foods and they have clashing personalities."
When we say something "clashes," we mean that it is very different from something else ? it causes problems with that other thing.
So, "clashing personalities" would be very different personalities ? the opposite of someone else's personality.
Clarissa says, "Oh, really?
Does that cause problems?"
Fabian says, "Yes, sometimes it does (cause problems).
One (child) is playful all the time and the other one is always pensive."
"To be playful" means that you always want to play, you always want to have to fun.
"To be pensive" means to be thoughtful, to be thinking about something all the time.
Often, people are pensive when they're sad or worried, but not necessarily.
"To be pensive" means to be thinking about something.
Fabian says his babies "get on each other's nerves more often than not."
There are a couple of expressions there: the first is "to get on each other's nerves" (nerves).
"To get on each other's," or "to get on someone's nerves," means to bother or annoy them, to do something that makes the other person angry.
Usually we have this expression when two people are together for a long time, and they keep bothering each other.
Every hour, every day, there seems to be some problem between them ? they're "getting on each other's nerves."
Well, the babies "get on each other's nerves more often than not."
The expression "more often than not" means frequently, often, most of the time.
"More often than not, I wake up at 7:00 in the morning" ? usually, unless I don't, but usually I do!
Fabian says, " I can't believe (the babies) have the same parents."
Maybe they don't, Fabian!
Clarissa says, "You're telling me!"
That expression, "you're telling me," is a phrase we use to show that what another person has said is correct, or that you understand what another person is talking about because you agree with them, or you have had a similar experience.
For example, someone says, "Oh, I had to pay $1,500 for rent this month, it's so expensive," and you say, "You're telling me!
I have to pay $2,000 in rent."
Clarissa says, "You're telling me," meaning she agrees or understands what Fabian says.
"I sometimes wonder how two babies born at the same time ("twins," we would call them) can be so different."
Then you hear a barking sound, the kind of sound that a dog would make, and we realize that Fabian and Clarissa are not talking about human babies; they're talking about little animals.
We usually use the word "baby" to refer to a human, but sometimes people use that in talking about an animal.
A baby dog is called a "puppy."
Clarissa then says, "Oh, my precious little babies are hungry."
"Precious" is a word that means very special, very valuable ? either because of a money or emotional reasons.
When you love something very much, you say it's "precious."
Sometimes you can even use that word about your husband or wife; you can say, "Oh, my precious ? my precious darling."
I say that every day to my wife!
Clarissa says, "We'd better get home so they can eat," meaning we now have to leave ? we ought to, we should get home, or go home, so the dogs can eat.
Fabian says, "I'd better get home to mine (to my, in this case, dogs).
They'll be crawling up the walls if I don't get back soon with their treats!"
"To crawl up the walls" is an expression which means you have too much energy ? you're very nervous, anxious, maybe worried or stressed.
You could also be very annoyed by some situation.
"The noise outside had me crawling up the wall" ?
I was very upset.
In this case, the dogs are excited, which is why they are "crawling up the walls."
The verb "to crawl" (crawl) usually means to get down on your hands and knees and move forward.
Little babies first crawl, and then they learn to walk.
In this case, the dogs are going to be crawling up the wall if Fabian doesn't get back with their treats.
A "treat" (treat), in the dialogue, means something that is very tasty, something that tastes good, usually something you give to a child or to a pet ? a dog or a cat ? in between their main meals.
So, they eat breakfast at 8 and they get a treat at 10, usually something sweet but not always.
"Treat" has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
We also talk about Americans and their pets, and what some Americans do with their pets that you may not believe.
Take a look at our culture note in the Learning Guide for a discussion of that.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
