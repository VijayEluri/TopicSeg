Our dialogue between Ricky and Shawn begins by Ricky saying, "Aren't you done with your taxes yet (aren't you finished with your taxes yet)?"
"Taxes" are payments ? money ? that you have to give the government for some reason.
Here in the United States, we have different kinds of taxes.
We have an income tax; "income" is the money you get for your job or other investments.
Income taxes are, in the U.S., paid by everyone who makes a certain amount of money, and the more money you make, the more taxes you're supposed to pay, although it does not always happen that way.
Everyone who lives in the U.S., or is a U.S. citizen, and makes a certain amount of money must file their taxes every year to the federal government and most state governments.
Ricky is asking if Shawn is "done," or finished, with preparing her taxes.
We sometimes say "to prepare your tax return."
The "return" is the actual form that you fill out your information on to send to the government.
Shawn says, "No, not yet.
"
Ricky says, "Can I help?"
Shawn says, "That would be great.
I think I'm almost done, but it'd be great if you could look it over (it would be great if you could look it over)."
"To look over something" is a phrasal verb meaning to review something, to read something and check to make sure it is correct and accurate.
Shawn says, "This is the first year I haven't been exempt or filed an EZ tax return."
"To be exempt from something" means that you are not required to do something; in this case, not required to pay something.
If you make very little money in the U.S., you are usually exempt from paying taxes ? you don't have to pay taxes.
Shawn says that in the past she's file an EZ tax return.
An "EZ" (which is spelled: the capital letter "E" and the capital letter "Z," obviously standing for the word "easy") is a tax return that the U.S. government started a few years ago to make it easier for people who don't make a lot of money to fill out their tax return.
In the United States, your tax returns must be "filed," or sent to the government, by April 15th every year.
Ricky offers to help Shawn, he says, "What are brothers for?"
This is an expression we use to mean that's what I'm here for; that is what being a brother, in this case, means.
You could say, "What are sisters for?"
You're saying, "I'm happy to help, that's why I'm here."
Ricky says, "Okay, you've entered your earnings, including your salary and dividends."
"Your earnings" refers to all of the money that you receive from any source ? from your job, from investments in the stock market; anything that you get is considered your earnings.
Your "salary" (salary) is the amount of money you get for working for a company or organization.
"Dividends" refers to the money you get from your investments.
Sometimes companies who have stock will pay dividends; once a year, they will give you money because you are invested in their company.
Ricky says to Shawn, "You have no dependents."
A "dependent" is a person, usually a child, who "depends on," or relies on, another person for their financial support: someone gives them food, housing, clothing, and so forth.
In the U.S. tax system, if you are a parent who has children, you don't have to pay as many taxes; if you have a lot of children, you pay even less.
These are called "dependents."
Sometimes dependents could be your older father or mother, or grandparents, who you have to give money to, to support.
If they rely on you ? if they depend on you ? then they're considered dependents also, and you pay lower taxes because of that.
The word "dependent" has a couple of different meanings in English, as does the phrasal verb we talked about earlier, "to look something over."
Take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of these expressions.
Shawn says, "I just hope I picked (or selected) the right number of withholdings."
"Withholdings" is money that you do not receive in your paycheck as part of your salary, but goes directly to pay your taxes.
For example, if you get paid every two weeks you will receive some money, but the government will have the company withhold money from you.
"To withhold" means not to give something to someone that otherwise belongs to them.
So, if you make $1,000 every two weeks, you may have to pay 100 or $115 to the government in taxes.
That's because the government is not going to wait until the end of year, or April 15th, for you to pay all of your taxes; you have to pay some of them every time you receive a paycheck, and that money is called "withholdings."
Shawn says, "I'd like to get a tax refund, rather than have to pay."
A "tax refund" is money the government gives back to you if you withheld too much money.
So, you may have told the government to take too much money from your paycheck every week, then the government gives you money back.
This is always, of course, a good thing ? a "refund," when someone returns money to you.
If you didn't withhold enough money, then you have to pay the government the rest of the taxes on April 15th.
Ricky says, "Well, you can take the standard deduction here, but I suggest itemizing your medical expenses and your charitable contributions."
A "deduction" is something that you take out of something, something you subtract from something else.
To deduct 2 from 10 would give you 8.
The "standard deduction" is what the government says everyone can take out their income when they are calculating their taxes.
The reason they do this is because basically they're lowering the taxes on everyone's income.
The government also says that there are certain kinds of expenses that you can deduct from your income, so you don't have to pay taxes on them.
Many people, however, don't "keep track of," or don't write down or keep a record of all of the expenses they make every year, so they can just take the standard deduction.
The government says okay, it's this much money that you can take out of your income so that you will have lower taxes.
The opposite is to itemize your expenses.
"To itemize" means to make a detailed list of something, the expenses of what you have paid in the past year that the government says you can deduct from your income.
For example, if you spend a lot of money on medical care ? on going to a doctor, these medical expenses can be itemized and sometimes deducted from your income.
If you give a lot of money to a charitable organization ? a not-for-profit organization such as a hospital, a school, perhaps a church, these "contributions," or gifts, are also deductible; they can be part of your itemized deductions.
So charitable contributions, or gifts, are itemized, and therefore deductible.
Ricky says, "It may make a big difference in the calculations."
"Calculations" are the numbers that you add, subtract, multiply, or divide in order to solve a math problem.
Shawn says, "Thanks. I'll crunch the numbers to find out."
"To crunch the numbers" is an informal expression meaning to make or do the calculations ? to add, subtract, multiply, and divide what you need to, to find the answer.
It is often used when talking about business or finance or taxes; we talk about crunching the numbers for our business to find out if we are going to make money this year.
It's just another way of saying "to figure out."
Shawn asks Ricky what she owes him for all of this help ? what does she have to pay him.
Ricky jokes, "That depends on the size of your refund check!"
The "refund check" is the money that the government gives back to you if you've withheld too much money for your taxes.
Ricky is saying, "If the government gives you a lot of money back, then you will have to pay me more."
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
