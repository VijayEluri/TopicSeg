Aren't you done with your taxes yet? 
No, not yet. 
Can I help? 
That would be great. 
I think I'm almost done, but it'd be great if you could look it over. 
This is the first year I haven't been exempt or filed an EZ tax return. 
No problem. 
What are brothers for? 
Okay, you've entered your earnings, including your salary and dividends. 
You have no dependents... 
I just hope I picked the right number of withholdings. 
I'd like to get a tax refund, rather than have to pay. 
Well, you can take the standard deduction here, but I suggest itemizing your medical expenses and your charitable contributions. 
It may make a big difference in the calculations. 
Thanks. I'll crunch the numbers to find out. 
So what do I owe you for all of this help? 
That depends on the size of your refund check!
