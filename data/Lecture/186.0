Was that Diane you were talking to just now? 
Yeah, do you know her? 
Diane and I used to work together. 
She looked happy. 
Yeah, she's dating a new man. 
I just got the scoop. 
He's not her usual type. 
What do you mean? 
Well, he's a little younger than she is. 
That's no big deal nowadays. 
How much younger? 
Diane is 42 and he's 27. 
They're 15 years apart! 
Talk about robbing the cradle! 
Hey, didn't you just say that May-December romances aren't that uncommon? 
From what Diane tells me, they have a lot of things in common. 
Yes, I did. 
But, that was before I knew there was such a huge age difference between them. 
I know that my parents wouldn't approve of me dating a woman 15 years older than me. 
Aren't you being a hypocrite? 
After your parents divorced , didn't your father remarry? 
And, isn't your step-mother 18 years younger than your father? 
But, but¡¦that's different. 
How? 
Because Diane is a woman and your father is a man? 
Yeah. 
I don't mind saying it. 
There's a double standard. 
I think a lot of people would agree with me. 
You may be right, but I'm not one of them.
