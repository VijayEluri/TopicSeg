Our story begins with Denzel saying to someone at the restaurant, "Excuse me, where is the restroom?"
He could also say, "Could you tell me where the restroom is?"
The server says, "It's down the hall, on your left," meaning walk down the hallway, you'll see the door on your left-hand side.
Denzel says, "Thanks."
He then says, "When I got into the bathroom, it was a mess."
Something that's a "mess" is unclean, it's unorganized or disorganized; it's the opposite of neat.
My mother would always tell me, "Jeffrey, your room is a mess!"
She was right.
Now, my desk is a mess!
Denzel says, "I walked into a stall and there was toilet paper all over the floor."
A "stall" (stall) is a small area with one toilet.
Usually, there is a toilet that has walls on either side and a door in front for privacy, so no one else can see in.
That's a "stall," or a "restroom stall."
So he walks into the restroom stall, "and there was toilet paper all over the floor."
"Stall," I should say, has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for additional definitions.
"Toilet paper" is a usually white, soft paper that is put on what we would call a "roll."
It goes round and round and round a center stick.
You tear the toilet paper off and use it to clean your skin, basically, after you have used the toilet.
He then says, "There were no toilet seat covers and the toilet wouldn't flush."
The "toilet" is usually a device that is made from a material called "ceramic," and you either sit on the toilet or you stand in front of the toilet in order to urinate.
The informal word for "urinate" would be "to pee" (pee); that's a word that children may use, not a word that you would use in general public.
The technical term is "to urinate."
The other thing that happens is, on a toilet, you can "defecate."
The informal, sometimes a word used by little children is "poop" (poop).
Again, you don't want to say that to your boss.
The technical word is "to defecate," although you probably don't want to tell your boss about that either!
So, a "toilet" is a device that takes that urination or the results of your defecation and washes it away, usually with water.
That's a "toilet"; "toilet seat covers" are the things that go on top of the toilet.
They're thin pieces of paper that you can put on so you don't have to sit on a public toilet seat.
Usually you will find these, if they are available, above the toilet on the wall.
Denzel says, "the toilet wouldn't flush.
"To flush" means that water moves in the toilet to take away the results of your going to the bathroom.
"To flush a toilet," then, means you push down on a handle so that the water comes out and washes things away.
Someone says to you, "Be sure to flush the toilet when you are finished," seems like an obvious thing to do, but some people need to be told ? children, in particular.
Denzel says, "Even the toilet seat was broken!"
The "toilet seat" is the part of the toilet that you would sit on.
He then says, "I gave up on the stall and decided to use a urinal."
"To give up on something," or "to give something up," is a phrasal verb meaning to stop trying to do something, usually because it is too difficult.
So, Denzel is having problems in the stall, so he decides to use a urinal.
"Urinal" (urinal) is related to the word "to urinate," it's a ceramic device that men can use ? women don't normally use a urinal.
It's something you would find in a men's bathroom, and it is a place where you can urinate by standing ? you don't have to sit down.
One of the few advantages of being a man, I think!
There are several different kinds of bathrooms that you might encounter in the United States; take a look at our Learning Guide, in our cultural note, where we talk about those different kinds of bathrooms, or restrooms.
Denzel says, "I went to wash my hands, but there was no soap in the dispenser."
There was no soap ? no detergent, what you use to clean something ? in the dispenser.
The noun "dispenser" comes from the verb "to dispense," which means to give something to someone.
A "dispenser" is a small device, in this case, a thing that holds liquid and allows you to get the liquid out.
The soap is liquid, and the soap dispenser is a place where you get the soap from; it's what holds the soap.
He then says, "I kept hitting the pump (on the dispenser), but nothing came out."
The "pump" (pump) is the part of the machine that you move up and down on the dispenser so you can get something out of somewhere.
If you are putting gasoline into your car, you use a "gasoline pump" ? takes it out of the tank below, and puts the gasoline into your car.
"When I turned on the faucet, water splashed all over my pants."
Denzel's having a bad day!
The "faucet" is the part of the sink where the water comes out.
The "sink" is where you wash your hands; the "faucet" is the little piece of metal where the water comes out of to wash your hands.
To say something "splashed all over your pants" means that the water went onto your pants.
We use this verb, "to splash," when we are talking about something liquid.
Sometimes you can splash something in someone's face.
In this case, the water splashed on his pants ? his pants got wet, the water went onto them.
Denzel says, "I looked for some paper towels to dry myself, but they were out."
"Paper towels are small, square pieces of paper you can use to dry your hands.
When we say "something is out," we mean it is no longer available ? there's no more remaining.
You may say to someone, "We're out of milk.
I need to go to the store to buy some" ? we no longer have any.
Well, they were out of paper towels, so Denzel tried using one of the hand dryers.
A "hand dryer" is something you find in many restrooms ? public restrooms ? nowadays.
It's a electric device that blows hot air onto your hands, and you move your hands back and forth so you can dry them.
It's better for the environment, of course ? at least I think it is!
Denzel ends the story by saying, "I couldn't believe what a mess this bathroom was.
I just thought, what happened here?
World War III?"
It was like there was a war in the bathroom; things were so messy, things were so broken.
Now let's listen to the story, this time at a normal speed.
