Our dialogue begins with the sales clerk saying, "Good afternoon.
What can I help you find?"
The "sales clerk" is the person who works at the store who sells you things.
Bo says, "I'm looking for a suit for work."
A "suit," for a man, usually has a jacket that you wear over a shirt, and pants.
Usually they are made of the same what we would call "fabric" (fabric).
"Fabric" is the material that you make clothing from.
"Suit" has several meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional definitions.
The sales clerk says, "I'm sure we have something for you.
Are you looking for a traditional or contemporary suit?"
"Contemporary," here, means modern (related to the present time).
"Traditional" would be what people have worn in the past.
Contemporary can also mean, for some people, a little too modern.
Traditional would be a more conservative suit, a suit that would look like the suits that people have worn in the past.
A contemporary suit might have a different look to it.
We use that word "contemporary" when talking about all sorts of things (lots of things).
You could have contemporary music, music made in the last 20-30 years, for example, or contemporary art.
Bo says he's not sure what he is looking for.
He says he'd like to try on some difference suits.
To "try on" is a two-word, or phrasal verb, which means to put on a piece of clothing.
A shirt, a jacket, shoes, pants, socks ? all of those would be pieces of clothing you could try on.
You put it on, or try it on, to see if you like it and you want to buy it.
The sales clerk says, "That's no problem.
Let me show you a few suits over here.
This is a two-button pinstripe suit."
A "button" is a round piece of plastic or wood, maybe metal, that is put into, for example, a jacket.
You have a button on one side and a buttonhole on the other, and the button goes into the hole to keep to keep the jacket together.
We have buttons on shirts; you could have buttons on your pants.
This is a two-button pinstripe suit.
The word "pinstripe" (pinstripe) refers to very thin, light colored lines that are put on a dark piece of fabric.
The lines go vertically, from top to bottom.
They're very thin; they are used in making formal business suits, a "pinstripe suit" we call it.
This is a two-button, so it has two buttons on the jacket ? a two-button pinstripe suit that's made of 100% wool and has a flat front.
"Wool" (wool) is a fabric that is made from the hair of sheep, or possibly a goat; usually it is a sheep.
And, wool is a very warm fabric; if you are cold, and you put on a wool jacket or sweater, you will become warmer.
This suit has a flat front.
A "flat front" means that there is no design or detail on the front.
It is plain in front; it's a flat front suit.
The sales clerk asks Bo, "What do you think?" meaning do you like it, do you dislike it.
Bo says, "It looks nice.
How about this one?"
The sales clerk says, "Oh, this is a very fine suit."
Of course, the sales clerk thinks all of the suits are fine, as long you buy one!
She says, "As you can see, it's a double-breasted suit."
To say something is "double-breasted" (breasted) means the jacket has two front parts.
Each part has buttons, so that when you close the jacket (when you put the front of the jacket together) one part goes over the other part, and there are two buttons showing.
So it's a little more complicated type of jacket, a double-breasted suit jacket.
The suit jacket is fully lined (lined).
When we say something is "lined," we mean that there is another layer of fabric inside the jacket, usually to make it look a little more professional, so that the front of the jacket (the outside of the jacket) looks a little different than the inside of the jacket.
There are two pieces of fabric as part of the jacket.
Bo says that he wants to try on the double-breasted suit.
The sales clerk also tells him that the pants are pleated (pleated).
When something is "pleated," we mean that there are folds that are sewn into the clothing, so it looks they have two or three small folds in the front of the pants.
You can also have a pleated skirt, if you're a woman ? or a man who likes to wear skirts!
The sales clerk says to Bo, "Just follow me to the dressing rooms in the back."
The "dressing rooms" are small rooms, usually with a mirror, that you can go and put on clothing in a store.
You can also have dressing rooms in a gymnasium, where two athletic teams are playing.
They would go into the dressing room to put on the clothes they need to play the game.
That's also called a "dressing room."
Bo comes out of the dressing room and says, "I like this single-breasted one."
A "single-breasted" jacket is a jacket that has buttons on only one side in the front, so that when you close the jacket one part goes over the other, and you have one line (or one column) of buttons that you can see.
Bo says he also likes the side vents.
A "side vent" (vent) is a long, thin opening at the side and the bottom of your shirt or jacket that allows you to move more easily.
Bo asks if all of the suits need to be dry cleaned.
To "dry clean" (two words) means to wash certain kinds of fabric without using water.
It's done at a special cleaning business; we call them "dry cleaners."
And, if you have certain kinds of clothing that will not be able to be washed without changing them, or ruining them (harming them), you can bring it to a dry cleaner.
The clerk says yes, these are all suits that need to be dry cleaned.
Bo says that the suit is a good fit.
When we say something is a "good fit," we mean it's the correct size and shape for your body.
Bo says he'll "take this one," meaning he'll buy this suit.
The sales clerk says, "Certainly. I'll ring you up (I will tell you how much money you need to give me).
Do you need anything else?
A vest, suspenders, or a garment bag?"
A "vest" is a piece of clothing like a jacket, but it doesn't have any sleeves for the arms.
"Suspenders" are long, thin pieces of cloth that go on the front of your pants (a man's pants, usually) and the back of your pants, and over your shoulders.
So, they are used to prevent your pants from falling down.
Suspenders are kind of old-fashioned.
You don't see a lot of men wearing suspenders; most just wear belts.
But you will still see suspenders for some men, especially with a very formal suit.
A "garment (garment) bag" is a piece of fabric or plastic that you use to hold clothing, to put clothing in so it doesn't get dirty.
On an airplane, sometimes you will see men or women with business suits that have a garment bag.
It's their clothing inside, and they use that so that it doesn't get dirty or it doesn't get folded ? we would say it doesn't get "wrinkled," meaning the fabric has lines in it after you take it out the bag.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
