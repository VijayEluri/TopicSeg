I really don't understand why we need new furniture. 
After we're married, we'll just take the things from each of our two apartments and that should do the trick. 
We each have some things we can keep and use, but it would be nice to have pieces that match. 
Right now, we have six dining chairs, each in a different style, and none of them are in the same style as the dining table your uncle is giving us as a wedding present. 
Yeah, that's true. 
At least, we won't have to shop for bedroom furniture. 
We're lucky that your parents are giving us some hand-me-down things, including a dresser, two nightstands, a headboard, and a wardrobe. 
All we need is a bed. 
Yeah, we got lucky when they decided to get new furniture and to give us their old pieces. 
That just leaves the living room. 
But we already have a couch and a love seat. 
That's true, but we still need a coffee table, two side tables, and at least two table lamps and a floor lamp. 
Do we really need all of that? 
If we plan to entertain, we do. 
All right. I was just hoping to get home in time for the game this afternoon. 
No problem. We only have six more stores to visit after this one. 
Six?! 
Yes, now come on. 
How are you going to get home in time for the game if you don't hurry up?
