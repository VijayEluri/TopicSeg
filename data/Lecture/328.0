Have you heard the latest news? 
No, what is it? 
Charlie was fired last Friday after the company found out that he had been cooking the books for over six months and had embezzled more than $50,000. 
Charlie? 
I don't believe it! 
He is the most upstanding person I know. 
I can imagine him stretching the truth now and then, but he's the last person I would think of as being truly dishonest . 
I would never think to question his integrity . 
It wasn't greed that made him do it. 
His wife has been ill and he couldn't pay the medical bills. 
I think he had the best of intentions in trying to get his wife the healthcare she needed, but it was only a matter of time before he got caught, no matter how well he covered his tracks . 
Well, I know he's a bad liar and he's not known to make mistakes, so I'm not surprised that someone caught on pretty quickly when there were irregularities in the accounting. 
What I don't understand is, if he was having financial problems, why didn't he tell anybody? 
Some of us may have helped. 
I don't know. 
Maybe he felt desperate and just didn't know what to do. 
I'm sure his wife being sick has been difficult for him. 
I don't think the company is going to press charges , though, under the circumstances . 
I'm glad to hear that. 
That's the last thing he needs. 
It's clear that he showed poor judgment , but he's not a criminal. 
That's the general consensus . 
I'm thinking of taking up a collection to help him out . 
Do you think the company would mind? 
Considering he was fired, I'd keep it a secret from management, but I think it's a great idea.
