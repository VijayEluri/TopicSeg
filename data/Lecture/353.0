Steve, my new boyfriend, decided to cook dinner for me. 
I was really excited, that is, until I tried his cooking. 
What do you think of the soup? 
This is so bland, and what are these little lumpy things in the soup? 
Of course I didn't say that aloud. 
It's delicious. 
It has a very interesting flavor. 
When Steve served the main course, a baked chicken, he asked, Steve: What do you think of the chicken? 
Is it too salty or spicy? 
Yes! It's too salty and it's so spicy I can hardly eat it without breathing fire. 
The outside of the chicken is overcooked and the inside is raw! 
But out loud, I said, Elaine: No, not at all! 
It has an interesting texture and I'm enjoying every bite. 
Oh, no. Is there more? 
Steve went into the kitchen and brought dessert. 
What do you think of this cake? 
This cake should be sweet, but it has a strange sour taste. 
Could there be something seriously wrong with Steve's taste buds? 
But aloud, I said, Elaine: It's yummy. 
It's the best cake that anyone has ever made for me. 
And it was true. 
I didn't care how bad the meal was. 
It's the thought that counts.
