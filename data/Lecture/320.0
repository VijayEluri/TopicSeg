Where are you going? 
I'm checking up on Rudy. 
I gave him a task an hour ago and I want to make sure he's doing it right. 
You're not micromanaging again, are you? 
Of course not. 
I'm only going to observe his work and make sure that he's following the detailed instructions I gave him. 
That sounds like micromanaging. 
If you're always looking over their shoulders , how are you ever going to develop trust with your employees? 
My employees will earn my trust by being meticulous with their work. 
Good employees don't mind me monitoring their progress. 
That may be true, but I heard Rudy and Jena talking and they said they're feeling a little resentful that you don't have more faith in their ability. 
They feel like you're treating them as though they're incompetent . 
I am not. 
You're making me sound like a control freak . 
I just call them like I see them. 
Micromanaging is a bad tactic and I can see why your employees are disgruntled . 
I resent that . 
I have a very good working relationship with my employees. 
I'm sure you do. 
I was just trying to help. 
I'm really not trying to butt in . 
Fine. 
You manage your staff the way you think best and I'll manage mine. 
Fine by me .
