Thanks a lot for offering to give me some pointers on how to use visuals for my presentation. 
I've never given a presentation like this before. 
I'm glad I can help. 
What do you plan to use? 
Well, I plan to show these slides for the first part of the talk. 
First, I have this pie chart that shows the types of services our company provides. 
Then, I have this bar graph to show how the company has grown in the past 20 years. 
But, I'm not really sure how to talk about them. 
Okay, first, when you're using a chart, make sure you explain what each part represents . 
For example, on this pie chart, I would explain that each slice of the pie represents a percentage of the business. 
Then, for this bar chart, I'd make sure to tell the audience what the X-axis and Y-axis stand for, and what each increment represents. 
That way, the trend that the company is following is clear. 
Are you planning on using this line chart , too? 
No, I changed my mind about that. 
I think it's a little confusing, but your tips on the other charts are really helpful. 
I have this flip chart , too, that I'm supposed to use but I'm not sure how. 
I don't want turn my back on the audience during the presentation. 
The second half of the presentation includes some audience participation, right? 
Then, I think it's fine to use it during that part of the talk. 
Any other questions? 
I don't think so. 
You've been so helpful. 
I hope you'll let me take you to lunch as a token of thanks. 
You don't need to treat , but I'd be happy to have lunch together. 
Let's go.
