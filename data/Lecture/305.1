Our dialogue begins with Remi saying, "We need to get these costumes sorted out."
A "costume" (costume) is clothing that you wear to look like someone else.
For example in a play, you might put on a costume for your "character," the person you are "portraying," or the person you are playing in that production.
A "costume" could also be for Halloween, for example.
So, Remi and Bryan are talking about costumes, perhaps for a play, and Remi says, "We need to get these costumes sorted out."
To "sort out something," or to "sort something out," is a two-word phrasal verb that refers to organizing and grouping ? putting together objects by similar characteristics, by the type.
So, I may have 20 pieces of paper on my desk ? actually, I have about 100 pieces of paper on my desk ?
I need to sort them out.
I need to put papers related to the podcast in one place, papers related to my household bills in another place, papers related to my vacation in a third place; that's to "sort something out."
Remi says, "I'm not sure we have ones (costumes) that will fit (or be the right size for) each person in this play."
A "play" is a performance with live actors at a theater.
"Play" has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Bryan says, "Let's see.
We need a shirt for Hector.
He's broad-shouldered, so this one would be too small."
To say a person is "broad (broad) -shouldered" means they have very wide shoulders ? there's a large distance between their two shoulders.
American football players often are very broad-shouldered; they have lots of muscles ? they're big on the top.
Bryan then asks Remi, "Any luck finding one over there?"
When you say to someone "Any luck?" meaning have you been able to.
Remi says, "No, but I think I found a dress for Lee Ann.
She's petite and thin, and I hadn't been able to find anything that would fit someone that slender."
These three words, "petite," "thin," and "slender" (slender) are similar.
To be "petite" means to be small, usually short and thin.
"Thin" is the opposite of "fat."
I am fat; my wife is thin ?
"petite."
Sometimes we say someone who is petite has "small bones."
To be "thin" means to be not fat, not overweight.
It's the same as "slender."
"Slender" is just another word for "thin."
Anyone can be "slender" or "thin"; "petite" usually describes a woman who is not only thin but is also somewhat short and small.
The word "petite" comes from the French word meaning small, as do a lot of words in English ? coming from the French.
Remi says, "All of the other dresses are for women with either pear-shaped or hourglass figures."
The word "figure" is used to describe the shape of your body.
If you say to someone "She has a nice figure," you mean she's attractive.
A "hourglass" or "pear-shaped" figure is a way of describing a woman's body ? two different kinds of shapes.
To be "pear-shaped" means to be in the shape of a pear (the fruit), which means you have a woman who's thin at top and a little wider at the hips.
To be "hourglass" ? to have an "hourglass" figure means that a woman has ? how shall I say it ? large breasts, a small waist, and large hips.
So, an "hourglass" is something you use ? people used to use many years ago to measure time.
And it is often made of glass, and you put sand at the top, and then there's a very small hole that goes into the part of the hourglass at the bottom.
So, it's wide, thin, and wide.
An "hourglass" figure would be a woman who has that kind of shape ? that kind of figure.
Bryan says, "Okay, at least that's some progress," meaning we are doing better now.
"What about Malcolm?" he asks.
"Unlike his brother (not like his brother) who is tall and skinny, he's big and fat."
"Skinny" (skinny) is the same as "thin," "slender" ? not fat.
"Skinny" isn't a negative description, but it could be.
You could say someone is "skinny" as a compliment ? as a nice thing.
But some people, for example a man, might find that to be a negative description ? to be "skinny."
Bryan describes Malcolm as not skinny, someone who is "big and fat."
Remi says, "He's not fat!
He's stocky" (stocky).
Someone who is "stocky" is short, but has a big body.
Not overweight, just large muscles and bones; that would be someone who is "stocky."
It's a neutral or positive description of someone, not a negative description.
To be fat is certainly considered negative, even though many Americans are fat.
Remi says that Malcolm is "muscular and not at all flabby."
To be "muscular" means to have big, strong muscles ? like me and Arnold Schwarzenegger!
To be "flabby" (flabby) means to be fat, to have a lot of extras fat, to be overweight.
It's something of an older word, but we still use it.
Remi says, "Oh, here's a pair of pants that would fit Pierre.
These are perfect, since he's not long-legged like all of the other men."
To be "long-legged" means to have long legs ? legs that are longer as a percentage of your total height.
So your legs are taller ? or your legs are longer, rather, than what is considered normal.
Pierre is "not long-legged," Remi says.
Bryan then says, "We're actually doing pretty well, I think."
Remi says, "We just need a costume for you," Bryan.
Bryan says, "Me?!
What do you mean?
I'm not in this play" ?
I'm not part of this play.
Remi says, "Oh yes, you are" ? you are part of the play.
"Ike," one of the other men "dropped out."
To "drop out" is a two-word verb meaning to decide not to do something.
We often use that word in talking about high school students that don't complete their education.
They "drop out" of school ? they leave school.
Well, one of the players "Ike dropped out, so they need a replacement."
A "replacement" is a substitute; it's a person who takes the place of someone or something else.
Bryan says, "Oh, no.
I thought I could avoid being in the play by volunteering to help with the costumes!"
He doesn't want to be in the play, that's why he's working with the costumes.
Remi says, "Sorry, but I don't think you can get out of it this time."
To "get out of" something is an idiom which means to have an excuse or a reason for not doing something; to find a good reason why you don't have to do something
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
