I was on vacation in Yosemite and I decided to send a postcard to my friend, Elaine, who was on her own vacation in Europe. 
Dear Elaine, I arrived safely two days ago and I'm having the time of my life . 
I met some nice people here and we've been keeping each other company . 
The weather has been ideal and we're off on another hike tomorrow. 
This is the life . 
Wish you were here . 
I hope you're having as good a time as I am. 
See you soon!

On the day I sent my postcard to Elaine, I got one from her. 
She wrote: 
Dear Vivian, I've had a nightmare of a trip. 
Our flight was delayed and we missed our connection to Oslo. 
I've been here three days and it has poured the entire time. 
There's nothing to do but sit in the hotel. 
What a dump ! 
It looks nothing like the pictures and it's not at all what I expected. 
I even got food poisoning the first day I was here! 
I hope your trip wasn't a washout like mine. 
I can't wait to get home! 
Elaine
