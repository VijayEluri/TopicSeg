Did you get an invitation to Kelly's party? 
Yes, I did. I'm going to send my regrets. 
How about you? 
I'm trying to find an excuse not to attend, without Kelly taking offense. 
Couldn't you just tell her that you have another engagement that night? 
I used that little white lie last time I turned down one of her invitations. 
I have to think of something else. 
How about telling her that you have to take care of a sick relative? 
That one always works for me. 
I've used that one, too. 
I told her that I was looking after my mother the last time she invited me to dinner. 
How about if you tell her you're on a special assignment at work and you have to work night and day to get it done? 
That's a little far-fetched, don't you think? 
I work as a store clerk. 
You've got a point there. 
What are you going to tell Kelly when you decline her invitation? 
I'm going to extend an apology and just say that I can't make it. 
That's it? I'd never thought of just saying "no." 
You know the old acronym: KISS ? Keep It Simple, Stupid. 
You're right. Hey! Who are you calling stupid?
