Curt. 
Oh, hi. 
Can I talk to you for a minute? 
I'm really busy right now. 
Just one minute. 
I promise it won't take long. 
Okay. 
Let's talk over here. 
Curt, I'm really sorry that I told Joyce that you had a crush on her. 
We were just talking last Friday and it just slipped out. 
But, I told you about Joyce in confidence. 
I know. 
It's totally my fault. 
I really regret saying anything. 
I wish I could take it back. 
I just want you to know that I'm really sorry and I hope that you'll accept my apology. 
What's done is done. 
I was really pissed off when I found out this morning but I 'm over it now. 
[cell phone ring] 
Hold on a sec. 
[long pause, muttering in background] 
Guess who that was? 
Who? 
Joyce. 
She wanted to know if I'd like to have lunch with her today. 
It was? 
That's great, maybe¡¦ 
And, maybe not. 
Maybe she just wants to tell me she's not interested in me. 
Or, maybe she likes you, too. 
Don't let your imagination run away with you. 
I won't but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
