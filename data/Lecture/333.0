Hi, I thought you might be out here. 
Geez, it's really cold! 
I know, but I really needed a smoke break after that long meeting. 
Can I bum one off you? 
I left my pack of cigarettes on my desk. 
Sure. Here's my lighter. 
What do you think about the new incentives the company is offering to employees to quit? 
Have you thought about it? 
Yeah, but I've smoked for 20 years. 
I tried going cold turkey once, but it didn't work. 
I'm doomed to a lifetime of ashtrays and stained fingers. 
I've been butting heads with my boyfriend for years. 
He wants me to quit, but I say, to each his own. 
The incentives are pretty good, though, I have to admit: a cash bonus and more money towards our health plans. 
Yeah, I could use the cash. 
Have you tried one of those nicotine patches? 
No, I haven't. 
Well...I'll try it if you will. 
Do you think it would work? 
I think I'm a lost cause. 
I'm not sure, but if you'll try them, I will, too. 
Okay, but I'm warning you. 
I have no willpower. 
All right, but just remember: no pain, no gain.
