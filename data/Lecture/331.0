What happened here? 
Is the washing machine not working? 
What do you mean? 
Why are all of your white T-shirts now pink? 
That just happens. 
Sometimes they turn pink, gray, or another color, depending on which clothes I put in a load. 
Didn't anyone teach you how to do laundry? 
You're supposed to separate your whites from your colors and wash them separately. 
It doesn't really matter. 
I don't mind if they get dyed a different color. 
As long as they get clean and the stains come out, I don't really care what color they are. 
I have some bleach that may be able to get your T-shirts white again. 
I better try before you put them in the dryer. 
Don't bother. 
It really doesn't matter to me. 
I'm almost done here. 
I'm just waiting for one more load to finish. 
What kind of detergent are you using? 
I ran out of detergent, so I've been using dishwashing liquid. 
It works pretty well. 
No wonder your shirts are as stiff as a board. 
Good thing you don't own any delicates or they would be completely ruined. 
Before you put your clothes in the dryer, clean out this lint filter. 
It's really dirty. 
I don't suppose you use fabric softener. 
No, I like to keep things simple and dry my clothes on a clothesline. 
I don't mind if they're a little stiff. 
Remind me never to ask you to do my laundry. 
Life is too short to worry about laundry.
