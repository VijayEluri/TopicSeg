Do you know what kind of mood Mom is in? 
Not really. 
Why? 
I really need a raise in my allowance and I'm waiting for the right time to ask. 
She'll be more likely to say "yes" if she's not feeling too grouchy . 
I wouldn't count on this being a good time. 
She looked a little upset after getting off the phone with Aunt Teri. 
Why? 
Aunt Teri has been down in the dumps since Cousin Frank decided to take a job in Cambodia. 
He's on cloud nine about this new job, but Aunt Teri is anxious about him moving so far away. 
I see. 
Well, I've got to think of some way to cheer her up . 
It's a lost cause if I ask her while she's angry, on edge, or depressed. 
You know that Mom is always happy to hear good news about school. 
Do you have anything new to report? 
I hadn't thought of that. 
I need to come up with something. 
Be patient. 
Wait for the right moment and then strike . 
I speak from years of experience. 
Right. 
Thanks.
