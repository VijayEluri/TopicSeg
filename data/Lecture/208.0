With our expansion into these new areas of business, I think we need to think seriously about changing our corporate image. 
We're much more than just a paper company now. 
I think you're right. 
Our brand has changed, and if we want to keep brand loyalty , we need to think about protecting and improving our product image . 
I agree that that's a key issue as we reposition ourselves in the industry. 
We can never lose sight of our end-users . 
And, even though we have registered trademarks on some of the new prestige products , we need to have a plan if we want to turn these new products into household names . 
I suggest we think about hiring a public relations firm . 
They may be able to help us update our corporate image and logo , and to shape our new corporate identity . 
Why don't I contact a few PR firms and set up some meetings? 
Yes, do that. 
That seems like the logical next step .
