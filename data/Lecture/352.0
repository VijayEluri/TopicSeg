I need to take out a small business loan and I'm trying to figure out what the interest rate would be. 
Do you understand this stuff? 
If it's the same as a mortgage loan, then I think I understand it in general terms. 
The interest rate would be the percentage of the amount you plan to borrow . 
It's usually calculated as an annual rate . 
So, for instance, a 10 percent interest rate on $100 would be $10 a year. 
Okay, I see, but how is my monthly payment calculated? 
As the borrower, your monthly payment depends on the term of your loan. 
Each month, you'll pay money toward the principal , plus the interest you owe the lender . 
The bank may also assess other fees for processing your loan, so make sure to read the fine print . 
Thanks. 
I understand it a little better now. 
Are you sure you want to go down that road ? 
You don't want to default on your loan and ruin your credit score . 
Maybe there are other options. 
Maybe there are, but I just don't see any right now. 
I have an appointment with an accountant next week and hopefully she can advise me on the best course of action . 
Good luck and let me know if I can help. 
Thanks, I will.
