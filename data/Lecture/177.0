Yasmine and I were going to a show at the Staples Center and Yasmine was driving. 
My friends warned me about her driving, but they didn't prepare me for this ride . 
Whoa , slow down! 
You almost rear-ended that SUV . 
No, I didn't. 
Take it easy. 
I have everything under control. 
I'm not even speeding, that much. 
You're the one who doesn't want to be late for the show. 
Yeah, but I want to get there in one piece . 
Hey, what are you doing? 
You're not going to make an illegal U-turn across four lanes of traffic , are you? 
I have to. 
Why? 
I was going the wrong way on a one-way street . 
Oh, geez. 
I think you just took ten years off my life . 
Don't be such a wuss . 
Buckle up and enjoy the ride. 
We're just getting started.
