Where have you been? 
Do you know what time it is? 
I'm sorry, Dad. 
I lost track of time. 
Lost track of time? 
We've been worried sick about you. 
You were supposed to come straight home after school. 
I know, but Janet was showing me something in her locker when a fight broke out in the hallway. 
The vice principal, Mr. Lopez, finally came out and broke it up. 
That still doesn't explain why you're late. 
And, I don't want any excuses. 
Well, one of the guys in the fight was Dan, Janet's brother. 
Mr. Lopez called their parents and I waited with her until they got there. 
I never liked Dan. 
He's trouble. 
I don't want you hanging around with him. 
I don't. 
I'm friends with Janet, not her brother. 
I didn't do anything wrong. 
Oh, really? 
You missed curfew last week and now you're late again. 
Just wait until your mother hears about this. 
You 're grounded for a week. 
Dad! 
That's not fair! 
None of my friend's parents are as strict as you are. 
That's enough. 
I won't have you talking back to me. 
Now, go to your room.
