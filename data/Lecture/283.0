I had a little time between appointments and stopped at a fast food restaurant to get some lunch. 
The idea was to save time by using the drive-thru, but it didn't work out that way. 
Welcome to McDenny's. 
May I take your order? 
Yes. 
I'd like a cheeseburger, an order of French fries, and a large soda. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
Can you speak up and speak directly into the microphone? 
I can barely hear you. 
Oh, okay. 
I want to order one cheeseburger, one order of fries, and a large soda. 
That's four hamburgers, an order of French fries, and a sundae. 
Would you like anything else? 
No, I mean, yes. 
That order isn't right. 
I wanted one cheeseburger, one order of fries, and a soda. 
No problem, sir. 
There's no need to shout. 
I can add those to your order. 
That's four hamburgers, one cheeseburger, two orders of French fries, a sundae, and a soda. 
Your total comes to $18.95. 
Please pull up to the next window. 
Wait! 
Hello, hello. 
There's been a mix-up. 
Hello! 
Please pull up to the next window, sir. 
There are cars behind you and you're holding up the line. 
But you don't understand. 
My order is all wrong. 
I don't want five burgers! 
Well, sir, if you've changed your mind, just tell me your new order. 
There are other customers waiting. 
Forget it. 
Cancel my order. 
I've lost my appetite!
