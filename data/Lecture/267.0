I was driving down the street when I saw a police car behind me. 
Suddenly, it turned on its siren . 
I realized that I was being pulled over . 
Can I see your driver's license , registration , and proof of insurance ? 
Sure. 
Here you are, officer. 
Did you know that you were speeding ? 
You were going 70 in a 55 mile an hour zone . 
I was? 
No, I didn't know. 
You also ran a red light and your brake light is out. 
I see that your tags have also expired . 
I'm going to have to cite you for all of that. 
I'm sure I didn't run a red light, and I didn't know my brake light wasn't working. 
I just renewed my registration and I'm still waiting for my new tags to arrive in the mail. 
Is there any way I can get away with just a warning ? 
I'm afraid not. 
What's the fine for all of those violations ? 
That information is on the back of the citation . 
Here you are. 
Have a nice day. 
Thanks. 
Thanks a lot!
