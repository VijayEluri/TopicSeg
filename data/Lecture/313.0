What do you think of our new neighbor? 
I don't know. I haven't met him yet. 
Me neither, but I think he's a shady character. 
Why do you think that? 
Well, when he was moving in, I tried to shoot the breeze with him and he was shifty. 
When I asked him what line of work he was in, he was very evasive. 
Maybe he just didn't want to talk to a busybody when he was busy moving boxes. 
Have you thought of that? 
I wasn't being a busybody. 
I was just being neighborly. 
When I offered to help him, he practically kicked me out of his apartment. 
Okay, you must be right. 
He's probably a serial killer. 
I wouldn't put it past him. 
Come on. My guess is that he just wants some peace and quiet. 
He wants peace and quiet to do what? 
That's what I want to know. 
I think we should just mind our own business. 
You can do what you like, but I'm going over there and I'm getting some answers. 
If I have live next to him, I'm entitled to know something about him. 
Why don't you leave the man alone? 
He's entitled to some privacy. 
And plus, he probably won't let you in. 
That's what you think. 
I'm not taking no for an answer. 
That poor man!
