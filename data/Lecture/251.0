Excuse me. 
I'm in the window seat. 
Oh, sure. 
Let me get up and let you in. 
Thanks. 
Are you traveling on business? 
Yes, I am. 
I'm changing planes in Denver on my way to South Carolina, and then I'm off to Georgia on Wednesday. 
There's no rest for the wicked. 
That's a lot of traveling. 
Doesn't your husband or boyfriend mind? 
Oh, I'm not married or seeing anyone. 
How about you? 
Where are you headed? 
I'm going to Jacksonville, Florida to visit my parents for a few days, but I'll be back in Los Angeles by next weekend. 
Are you from L.A. originally? 
No, I was born and raised in Kentucky, but I've been living in L.A. for the past four years. 
What part of L.A. do you live in? 
I live not too far from the airport in Westchester. 
Have you heard of it? 
That's a coincidence! 
I just rented an apartment in Westchester and I'm moving in when I get back. 
With all of this traveling, it made sense to move closer to the airport. 
That seems like a wise move. 
You know, since I'm in the neighborhood, let me know if you need any help moving. 
I'd also be happy to show you around and give you the rundown on some of the better restaurants in the area. 
Here's my card. 
The number on the bottom is my cell phone. 
Thanks. 
That would really be nice. 
By the way, I'm Fay. 
I'm Dustin. 
It's nice to meet you. 
You, too.
