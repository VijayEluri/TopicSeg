What are you doing?! 
Why are you trying to hit that guy? 
He deserves it. 
He insulted you. 
I'm going to knock his block off! 
Stop it! Be civilized. 
This isn't some free-for-all. 
You can't punch a guy just because he said something offensive. 
Oh, yes I can. 
Let me at him! 
I'm going to clobber him. 
If you take another swing at him, he's going to have you arrested for assault. 
Get a hold of yourself. 
I'm just trying to defend my sister's honor. 
What's wrong with that? 
Nothing, but violence isn't the answer. 
Let's get out of here and cool off a little. 
All right, but if I ever see that guy again, he'll get what's coming to him. 
Okay, okay, let's go. 
You said he insulted me. 
What did he say? 
He said you had nice legs. 
The nerve of that guy! 
That's it? He said I had nice legs and you tried to hit him? 
Isn't that enough? 
He can't say those things about my little sister. 
I think we need to have another talk about you being overprotective. 
I'm an adult. 
I can take care of myself. 
Yes, but I'm your big brother and I'm making sure that no one messes with you. 
That's what big brothers are for. 
You don't have to thank me. 
Thank you? Uh!
