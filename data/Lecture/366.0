Can you believe these prices? 
I know we're in a recession , but the cost of everyday necessities shouldn't skyrocket overnight . 
I think it has something to do with the shortage of produce . 
I don't know why I'm surprised that stores like this one try to gouge customers at the drop of a hat . 
I guess it's par for the course ? anything to make a little extra money. 
You said it ! 
Even when there's a good supply, the prices are never dirt cheap . 
Any savings the stores get are never passed on to the customers. 
I have a mind to stop buying fruits and vegetables until the prices go down. 
You mean a boycott ? 
Yeah, I won't eat any fruits and vegetables until these high prices come down. 
How long do you think you can keep that up ? 
I don't know, but let's find out!
