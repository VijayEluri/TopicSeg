I was mugged while I was walking home last night. 
This morning, I was at the police station with a sketch artist to see if we could come up with a picture of what the thief looked like. 
Okay, you said that this was a man in his 40s. 
Can you tell me what shape his face was: thin, round, oval, or square? 
His face was long and thin, I think. 
Were his eyes more round, bulging, or squinty? 
Well, I think they were round, but not too round, and he had bushy eyebrows. 
He also had a pointed nose, not a hooked one. 
Take at look at this so far. 
Is this right? 
His nose in the sketch is a little too turned up. 
It was more straight. 
What about his ears? 
Were they big or small? 
And his mouth? 
Did he have thin or thick lips? 
His ears were average size and they didn't stick out too much. 
His lips were more thin than thick. 
We're almost done. 
What about his hair? 
Did he have long or short hair? 
Oh, didn't I tell you? 
He's bald. 
Okay, then. 
I'm done. 
What do you think? 
Is this the guy? 
Wow, you've done a great job. 
Yeah, that's him. 
That's the guy who stole my wallet. 
You know, he looks familiar. 
I have a feeling I've seen him before. 
I hope so. 
Maybe you can help find him. 
Yeah, now if only I could remember where I've seen him before...
