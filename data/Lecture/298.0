I wanted to visit the National Museum, but when I arrived, it was closed. 
Can you tell me the hours of operation for the Museum? 
It's open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday. 
It's closed on Sunday. 
Thanks. 
I'll be back tomorrow. 
The next day, I arrived at the Museum at 10 a.m. and the same guard was there. 
Hello, again. 
Can you tell me if the Museum has any tours? 
The Museum has a self-guided tour . 
You can get information at the ticket window. 
Oh, thanks. 
Do you know if I can use my flash to take photos in the Museum? 
You can take pictures, but flash photography is prohibited . 
Food and drinks are prohibited, too. 
Oh, I guess I need to get rid of this bottle of juice before I go in. 
Do you know if all of the exhibits are open to the public today? 
The east wing is under construction, but the rest of the galleries are open. 
The sculpture and painting galleries are to your left, and the artifacts are to your right. 
Thanks a lot. 
How much is the admission charge ? 
It's $10.00 for adults, $3.00 for children, and $5.00 for seniors and students with picture ID . 
The people at the ticket window can help you with that. 
Thanks. 
Just one more question. 
Yes? 
If I leave after I pay, can I come back in? 
Yes. 
You just have to show your stub . 
Anything else? 
Oh, no. 
Thanks a lot. 
Sorry to have bothered you. 
No trouble at all.
