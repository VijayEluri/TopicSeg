What's the matter? 
You look terrible. 
Haven't you seen the paper? 
The stock market went down a lot yesterday. 
The NASDAQ is down 100 points and the Dow is down 30! 
My portfolio is in big trouble. 
I knew you had some stock options in this company, but I didn't know you were so heavily invested in the market. 
I'm invested in the bond market , in derivatives, and I have shares in a lot of companies that took a nosedive yesterday. 
I'm sure you have a good stockbroker who has made sure that your portfolio is diversified and you have different kinds of securities. 
That's my problem. 
I don't have a stockbroker. 
I decided to invest on my own and to go for less secure stocks hoping for a better return. 
I thought I could tell the difference between a bear and a bull market as well as the brokers. 
I guess I was wrong. 
The drop in stock prices won't last. 
I'm sure the market will rebound. 
Just don't panic and sell everything. 
The old saying, "buy low, sell high," is still a good idea, I think. 
I know, I know. 
I won't do anything stupid ? that is, I won't do anything even more stupid. 
I'll wait to see what happens before taking any action. 
That's a good idea. 
Come on. 
I'll buy you lunch. 
Thanks. 
Now that I'm poor, I won't say "no" to your charity.
