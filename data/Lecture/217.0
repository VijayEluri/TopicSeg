Hello, Portland Airport, Lost and Found. 
Hello. 
I was a passenger on a SunCal Airlines flight yesterday and I think I left my keys on the plane. 
I see. 
To claim the item, you have to fill out a claim form. 
What did you lose again? 
Some luggage? 
You'll need your claim receipt to get your luggage. 
No, I lost some keys on the airplane. 
Keys. 
I think I left them on my seat. 
Is it possible to find out if anyone has turned them in to your office? 
I don't know. 
Can you describe them? 
Well, they're on a key chain and there are eight keys on it, including a car key. 
Was there anything distinctive about the key chain? 
You'll need to prove ownership if you want to claim them. 
No, it's a plain key ring. 
Maybe I should come down to the office to see if I can identify them. 
What happens to property that's unclaimed? 
We keep it for 30 days and then we dispose of it. 
Don't worry. 
We don't have a policy of finders, keepers. 
If you lost some luggage, it'll turn up. 
No, I lost some keys! 
Keys! 
Never mind. 
I'm coming down right now. 
That's a good idea. 
It's easier to pick up your lost luggage than for us to send it. 
Uh!
