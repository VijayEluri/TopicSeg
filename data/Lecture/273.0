I can't believe you told Mom and Dad about me driving the car last Saturday when I wasn't supposed to . 
I thought we had a deal. 
You wouldn't tell on me and I'd take you and Kathy to the movies this weekend. 
You're such a tattletale. 
I swear it wasn't me! 
Why would I tell? 
We do have a deal and I've held up my end. 
Forget it. 
The deal is off . 
There'll be no movie this weekend. 
Hey, I told you it wasn't me who spilled the beans. 
Are you sure it wasn't Jeffrey? 
Don't try to put the blame onsomebody else . 
I know it was you. 
How? 
You're a terrible liar. 
Well, if I did tell on you, I didn't mean to do it . 
Come on , please! 
I really want to see that movie this weekend. 
What can I do? 
Hmmm...that's a good question. 
How about doing my chores for two weeks? 
Two weeks?! 
No way. 
How about one week? 
You've got a deal. 
I'll take you if you do all of my chores for a week 
But I'm warning you . 
You're on notice . 
If you tell on me one more time, you'll be dead to me. 
Yeah, yeah. 
I heard you.
