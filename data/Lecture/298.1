Our dialogue, in this episode, covers some basic vocabulary you would need if you were going to visit a museum.
Here in Los Angeles, we have a couple of good museums.
We have the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; we also have two museums called "Getty": the Getty Center and the Getty Villa.
Of course, there are also great museums in New York and in Washington, D.C., in Boston ? several cities have very nice museums.
This episode begins with Rudy saying that he "wanted to visit the National Museum."
That's not a real museum; here in the U.S., the national museum is the Smithsonian Museum, and that's what we would call it, in Washington, D.C. Actually, there are several museums there.
Rudy goes to the museum, but when he gets there (when he arrives) it is closed.
So, he asks the "guard," or the security guard (the person who is like a police officer who is protecting the museum), Rudy asks the guard, "Can you tell me the hours of operation for the Museum?"
The expression "hours of operation" means the time that the building is open to the public; we call them the "hours of operation."
For example, a bank's hours of operation are usually Monday through Friday, 9:00 in the morning to 5:30 in the afternoon.
The guard says that the museum is "open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday.
It's closed on Sunday."
This would be somewhat unusual; museums are normally open on Sunday.
Some museums are open seven days a week; other museums are closed one day.
Rudy says, "I'll be back tomorrow."
So, he goes back the next day and sees the same guard there, and says to the guard, "Can you tell me if the Museum has any tours?"
(where they take you around and explain different parts of the museum).
The guard says, "The Museum has a self-guided tour."
A "self-guided tour" is when you don't have a "guide" (a person who goes with you and explains things).
They usually give you either a piece of paper that explains things, or, now, you can get audio receivers.
They are kind of like iPods that you walk around with, and when you come in front of a piece of art you will hear an explanation through your headphones.
The guard says that "You can get information (about the selfguided tours) at the ticket window."
Rudy says, "Oh, thanks.
Do you know if I can use my flash to take photos in the Museum?"
The "flash" is what is on a camera that produces a very bright light; in case it is dark, the light will make a better picture for you.
"Flash" has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
The guard says, "You can take pictures, but flash photography is prohibited."
"Prohibited" means not allowed, against the rules.
You could also say "forbidden."
So, like in most museums, you can't use a camera with flash; there are some museums where you can't use a camera at all.
The guard says, "Food and drinks are prohibited, too."
Again, that's pretty typical of a museum.
Rudy says, "Oh, I guess I need to get rid of this bottle of juice."
To "get rid (rid) of" something means to throw it away, to do something so that you no longer have it with you.
Usually it means throwing it away.
Rudy says I have "to get rid of this bottle of juice before I go in."
He then asks another question of the guard: "Do you know if all of the exhibits are open to the public today?"
An "exhibit" is, in a museum, a group of objects that are similar.
Usually museums have different exhibits ? different themes, different topics, perhaps even different time periods.
Sometimes they have special exhibits; these are usually pieces of art from other museums.
Rudy asks if "the exhibits are open to the public," meaning anyone can visit; you don't need any special permission.
The guard says, "The east wing is under construction, but the rest of the galleries are open."
The "wing" of a building is one section or one part of a building.
The White House in Washington, D.C., where the president of the United States lives, is divided into an east wing and a west wing.
In fact, there was a famous TV show called The West Wing that refers to that side of the White House ? that side of the building.
There are other meanings of this word, "wing," take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
The guard says, "The east wing is under construction," meaning they're doing work on it.
It's not finished yet; they're still building or changing it.
The guard says, "the rest of the galleries are open."
The "rest of the galleries" are the other rooms in the building.
A "gallery" is just a name of a large room in a museum.
We also use this same word, "gallery," to talk about a place were you can go and buy art; these are called "art galleries."
That's different; that's more like a store where you can go look at and buy pieces of art.
In a museum, a gallery is simply a room of the museum, or a collection of rooms.
The guard continues by saying that "The sculpture and painting galleries are to your left, and the artifacts are to your right."
"Sculpture" is a solid object of art, usually made from stone such as marble, or metal, possibly wood, or even clay.
These are all possible materials for sculpture.
Michelangelo's famous sculpture is of David, in Florence, Italy; that's an example of a piece of sculpture.
Notice that when we are talking about one work of art ? one sculpture ? we say, typically, "a piece of sculpture."
We use the same for art: "a piece of art."
"Painting" is, of course, when you have colors, either what we would call "oilbased" or "water-based" colors (different kinds of paint) that you put on a piece of (again, typically) white fabric (a white material): we call that a "canvas" (canvas).
A painter paints on a "canvas," that's the white piece of material that they use to paint their painting (their picture).
We don't say "a piece of painting," however; we just say "a painting."
"Artifacts" (artifacts) are things that were made by humans many years ago that were not necessarily meant to be pieces of art, but are now put in museums so that you can look at them, and some people consider them pieces of art.
Rudy then asks the guard, because Rudy has lots of questions, "How much is the admission charge?"
The "admission charge" is how much it costs to get into the museum.
You could use that same expression for a park or a zoo, or a similar place: the "admission charge."
In Los Angeles, the admission charge for most museums is around 10, maybe $15.
Some museums, such as the Getty Museum, are free.
The guard tells Rudy how much it costs to get into the museum.
He says, "It's $10.00 for adults, $3.00 for children, and $5.00 for seniors and students with picture ID."
A "senior" is someone who is, normally, more than 65 years old.
"Picture ID" is short for "picture identification," and this is something like a driver's license that has your picture on it, and your name.
Your passport is also a picture ID.
Many schools give their students IDs (little cards with their name and picture on it) so they can prove that they are a student.
Rudy then finally asks, "If I leave after I pay, can I come back in?"
And the Guard says, "Yes. You just have to show your stub" (stub).
Your "stub" is the small part of the ticket that you keep.
Usually, when you buy a ticket for a museum or a movie theater, they give you a ticket and they rip it in half, or they give you one part and they keep the other part.
The part that you keep is called the "stub," the "ticket stub."
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
