I'm sorry, say that again. 
I couldn't hear you over that guy at the next table shouting into his cell phone. 
That guy is so rude . 
We're trying to have a leisurely conversation over a cup of coffee, and we have to out shout some inconsiderate jerk . 
Do you think he realizes what a nuisance he is? 
I bet he doesn't. 
People don't seem to have any idea of cell phone etiquette . 
Cell phones should be banned from restaurants, don't you think? 
I completely agree. 
I don't need to know the intimate details of other people's lives. 
I sometimes wish I had a cell phone jammer . 
Like the other day, I was at the movie theater, and the woman sitting in front of me answers her cell phone and has a conversation during the movie! 
I would have kicked up a fuss or at least shushed her. 
I tried to shush her, but she pretended not to hear me. 
I wish... 
[Carl's cell phone rings] 
hold on one second . 
Hello, oh hi, Manny... 
[Stephanie's cell phone rings] 
Hello, yes, this is Stephanie. 
Oh hi, Leah. 
Oh sure. 
I can talk.
