My brother, his wife, and their two daughters are in town and I had promised the girls that I would take them to an amusement park. 
I don't really like roller coasters, but I knew the kids would like it. 
On Saturday morning, we drove down to the theme park. 
We parked and took a shuttle to the park entrance. 
We looked at the ticket prices and decided to buy a day pass for each of us. 
Maria, the younger of the two kids, is only 2-years-old, and children under three get in free. 
The first thing we did was stand in line for the biggest attraction in the park: a really big roller coaster. 
Actually, only Grace and I stood in line since Maria was too young to ride it. 
My brother and my sister-in-law took Maria to ride the Ferris wheel and carousel, and afterwards, we planned to meet near the concession stands so we could watch the parade at 2 o'clock. 
Grace and I finally made it to the head of the line and we got on the ride. 
I really don't like roller coasters. 
When we got off, I felt queasy and had to sit down for a few minutes before I could walk again. 
All in all, we had a good day at the amusement park. 
But, it will be long time before I go on a roller coaster again!
