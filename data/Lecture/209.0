I'm so glad it's Friday. 
Are you doing anything this weekend? 
I'm going snowboarding with James. 
Didn't you guys go bungee jumping last weekend? 
Yeah, and we plan to go cave diving in a couple of weeks. 
I didn't know you were into extreme sports. 
I guess it's a big adrenaline rush . 
It is. 
But for me, it's about pushing myself to the limit . 
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt? 
Sure. 
There's always a danger of getting hurt, but we don't do these sports competitively . 
It's just for fun. 
I like trying new stunts and seeing how far we can push the boundaries of the sport. 
Do you want to come with us sometime? 
Me? 
I'm not really the adventurous type. 
You never know. 
You might like it. 
After cave diving, we'll probably try climbing. 
Oh, that doesn't sound too bad. 
I've done some climbing before. 
I should tell you that we plan on going ice climbing . 
Oh. 
In that case, I think I'll pass . 
Have fun this weekend. 
Thanks and let me know if you change your mind.
