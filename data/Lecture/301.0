Good afternoon. 
What can I help you find? 
I'm looking for a suit for work. 
I'm sure we have something for you. 
Are you looking for a traditional or contemporary suit? 
I'm not sure. 
I'd like to try on some different ones. 
That's no problem. 
Let me show you a few over here. 
This is a two- button pinstripe suit that's made of 100% wool and has a flat front . 
What do you think? 
It looks nice. 
How about this one? 
Oh, this is a very fine suit. 
As you can see, it's double-breasted and is fully lined . 
The pants are pleated . 
Would you like to try it on? 
Sure. 
Just follow me to the dressing rooms in the back. 
Here you are. 
My name is Caroline. 
Just let me know if you need anything. 
I like this singlebreasted one. 
I like the side vents . 
All of these suits need to be dry cleaned , is that right? 
I travel a lot in my job and I worry about my suits getting dirty on the road. 
Yes, they all need to be dry cleaned, but since both of these suits are a dark color, that shouldn't be too big of a problem. 
How does that feel? 
It's a good fit and it's very comfortable. 
Okay. 
I'll take this one. 
Certainly. 
I'll ring you up. 
Do you need anything else? 
A vest , suspenders , or a garment bag to store the suit? 
No, thanks. 
I'll just take the suit. 
No problem. 
Just follow me.
