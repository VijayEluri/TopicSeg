I arrived a little early for my sales appointment with the office manager of Lyon Industries, and spoke to the receptionist . 
Hello. 
I'm here for my 11:30 appointment with Sue Gibbons. 
What is your name? 
It's Juri Lakoff. 
I'll let her know that you're here. [Speaking into the telephone] 
Sue, this is Rhonda. 
Your 11:30 appointment is here. 
Should I send him up ? 
Okay, I'll do that. [Hangs up the telephone] 
Ms. Gibbons says that she's running a little late and is tied up in another meeting right now. 
She should be wrapping things up very quickly and will be free in a few minutes. 
Would you like to wait in the reception area right over there? 
Sure. 
No problem. 
Can I get you something? 
Coffee or tea? 
No, I'm fine. 
I was just wondering how many employees you have in this office. 
I don't know precisely , but I think we have about 80. 
Oh, that's a lot 
Is the company planning on expanding ? 
I'm sorry, but I really don't know. 
I'm sure Ms. Gibbons can answer those questions for you. 
Right, right. 
I didn't mean to pump you for information . 
I was just trying to get the inside scoop on the company before my meeting. 
I understand. 
Now, if you'll excuse me , I need to answer this call. 
Ms. Gibbons should be finished with her other meeting in no time . 
Oh, sure. 
I didn't mean to keep you. 
Sorry.
