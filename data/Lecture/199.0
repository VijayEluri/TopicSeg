What are you working on? 
If I tell you, will you promise not to laugh? 
All right. 
What is it? 
It's a love letter to Julie. 
Isn't it a little premature ? 
You've only been going out for a month. 
Maybe, but I really want her to know how I feel. 
Let me see it. 
Dear Julie. 
I'm writing this letter to pour my heart out to you. 
When we met, it was love at first sight and I can't get you out of my head . 
You mean everything to me. 
Now that we're together, how can I ever live without you? 
So, what do you think? 
I thought it would have some simple sweet nothings . 
I didn't expect it to be this heavy . 
Do you think it needs more terms of endearment ? 
Maybe I should have called her "my love," "my darling," or "sweetheart." 
Tell me the truth, do you think it's too much? 
I don't want to scare her off . 
Well, I know you're head over heels in love with her, but if I were you, I'd play it by ear . 
Give it to her when you feel the time is right. 
Okay, thanks. 
I'll try to play it cool , for now.
