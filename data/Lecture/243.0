Hello. 
Levin's Music. 
Hello. 
I was wondering if you carry classical CD's. 
Yes, we have a pretty large selection. 
What are you looking for? 
I'm trying to find the latest Reunion Island Ensemble CD. 
I'm not sure we have that in stock. 
We have a lot of CD's on back order. 
Can I put you on hold while I check? 
Sure. 
Okay. 
We have one copy of their 2005 CD left. 
Is that the one you're looking for? 
Yes, it is. 
How much is it? 
Let me check the price. 
It's $17.95. 
That's great. 
Could you hold that for me? 
We can reserve it for you for 24 hours. 
When you come in, just go to the customer service desk. 
What's your name? 
It's Ariel, A-R-I-E-L. 
What are your store hours? 
We're open weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., and 9:00 to 6:00 on weekends. 
I'll be in later today to pick that up. 
Thanks a lot for your help. 
It's no problem. 
Is there anything else I can help you with? 
No, that's all. 
Thanks, again. 
You're welcome and thanks for calling Levin's.
