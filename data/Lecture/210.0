Our family decided to take a road trip across the country this year. 
The kids were really excited and my oldest son wanted to help navigate. 
Before the trip, we looked at the road maps and decided on our route and the points of interest we would try to see. 
Since we wouldn't be taking a camper, we needed to make hotel reservations along the way. 
After a little planning, we were ready to go. 
The kids were behaving themselves the first day. 
My daughter was a little car sick in the morning, but we made it to our first stop without any major problems. 
On the second day, though, the kids were really acting up. 
They kept asking, "Are we there yet?" and they wanted to stop at every rest stop. 
My youngest son, who is only four, kept calling out the mile markers as we passed them, and I thought my head would explode if he didn't stop. 
On top of that, my wife wanted to stop every few miles for a photo op and I thought we'd never get to the next town. 
By the third day, I was really questioning the wisdom of taking three young children on the road for 10 days. 
I suspect that after this vacation, I'll need another one to recover from it.
