Can I help you find something? 
Yes. 
Can you tell me where the non-fiction books are? 
Are you looking for hardbacks or paperbacks? 
I'm not sure. 
I think hardbacks. 
Well, the non-fiction new releases are at the front of the store. 
The nonfiction section is behind the fiction shelves on your right. 
The hardbacks are on the top shelves and the paperbacks on the bottom ones. 
Is there a specific book I can help you find? 
I'm looking for an old book and I'm not sure of the title. 
It's something like, "The Literary Crisis." 
Do you know the name of the author? 
No, I don't. 
I saw it mentioned online and I actually wrote down the ISBN, but I can't find it now. 
Well, if it's an old book, it may be out-of-print, but let me look it up in our system. 
If it was a bestseller at one time, there's a chance that it's still in print. 
Let me check¡¦Okay, here it is. 
It was published in 1982, and unfortunately, it is out-of-print. 
You may want to try a used bookstore, like Bookwoman's down the street. 
Thanks, I'll give them a try. 
I'm also looking for a biography. 
Can you tell me where they are? 
Sure. 
The biographies are behind the reference section over there. 
Let me know if you need any more help. 
Thanks. 
I appreciate it.
