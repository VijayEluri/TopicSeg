We're on an airplane in this episode.
Hal begins by pushing the call button to get the attention of the flight attendant.
The "call button" is a small button that you push when you need help or need "service," you need someone to help you.
This is especially true on an airplane.
The call button is usually above your head, and you click on it and the flight attendant is supposed to see it and then come to help you.
The "flight attendant" ? used to be called the "stewardess" for a woman, and "steward" for a man ? is the person who works on the airplane, and brings food and drinks, and perhaps blankets and pillows to the people who are on the airplane, sitting in the seats.
They are also the people responsible for helping you if there's an emergency on the airplane.
The flight attendant comes and says, "Yes?
What can I do for you?"
How can help you?
Hal says, "It's very cold in the cabin."
The "cabin" is the part of the airplane where the passengers are seated.
The front of the airplane, where the "pilots" are, the people who are operating the plane, is called the "cockpit."
The main part of the airplane, where everyone sits, is called the "cabin."
Hal says, "It's very cold in the cabin.
Is it possible to get a blanket," a piece of thick cloth that you put on you to keep yourself warm.
The flight attendants says, "We're out of blankets, but here's a pillow," a bag that is soft that you can put your head on.
Of course if you are cold, having a pillow doesn't really help!
Hal then says, "Okay, thanks.
I was asleep (I was sleeping) during the meal service."
The "meal service" is the time in your airline flight when they serve you food and something to drink.
This used to be free on most airlines in the United States, now many times you have to pay for any food that you want.
So, he missed the meal service and he wants to get a meal, he wants to get some food.
The flight attendant says, "We don't have any more of the Baked Chicken.
We only have the Bean Salad left."
"Bean" (bean) is a pod or a seed that is cooked and eaten.
For example, in Mexico they have a lot of black beans, that's a common food.
"Bean" has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations of how we use that word.
Hal says, "Okay, I'll take that (meaning I'll have the Bean Salad, please).
Could I also get a drink?"
The flight attendant says, "What would you like?"
Hal says, "What do you have?"
Notice when we say that quickly, it sounds like "whada ya have," but slowly, "what do you have."
The flight attendant says, "The complimentary drinks are listed in our in-flight magazine."
If something is "complimentary, we mean it's free, there's no additional cost, it's included in your price.
"In-flight magazines" are magazines that are produced by the airline ? by the company that owns the airplane ? and given to passengers for free.
They usually have articles inside of them and information about the airplane.
"The complimentary drinks (the free drinks) are listed in our in-flight magazine," she says, "Beer, wine, and other cocktails are $4."
A "cocktail" (cocktail) is an alcoholic drink usually made by mixing two or more liquids together, either soda and alcohol or different kinds of alcohol.
This is a "cocktail," it's a general term for an alcoholic drink that you would get at a bar, for example.
We used to call the women who would work in the bars and give you your drinks "cocktail waitresses."
Hal says, "I'll have a diet soda."
The flight attendant says, "We're out of diet soda."
"To be out of something" means to no longer have something because you've used it or you've sold it so there's nothing left.
If you, for example, drink all of the milk you have in your refrigerator, you could say, "We're out of milk.
We need to go buy some more."
Well, on this airplane, like many of the airplanes I have been on recently, they are out of many things; they are out of diet soda ? diet soda pop, like Coke or Pepsi.
Hal says, "How about just some water," meaning that all I want now is water.
Then he asks, "What's that?"
Something is happening on the plane.
The flight attendant says, "That's turbulence."
"Turbulence" (turbulence) are strong movements that you feel on a plane, usually because of wind.
The plane will move back and forth, or go up and down quickly.
This happens very commonly on airplane flights.
The flight attendant says, "Make sure your seatbelt is fastened."
Your "seatbelt" is something that goes usually around your waist and your shoulder that keeps you in your seat in case there's an accident.
You have seatbelts in your car, sometimes on a train, and always on a plane.
They are things that go around your waist and chest ? shoulder and chest ? to keep you in your seat in case there's an accident.
The flight attendant says to make sure your seatbelt is fastened.
You'll hear that expression a lot on an airplane: "Make sure your seatbelt is fastened."
"To be fastened" means to be connected.
In this case, it means that you are wearing your seatbelt.
We use that expression "wear" even though it really just means you are behind your seatbelt; your seatbelt is over you and protecting you.
So "fastening the seatbelt" means putting it on so that it is working correctly.
Hal says, "Could I get an airsickness bag, please?"
"Airsickness" is what happens when people are on an airplane and you have a lot of turbulence.
Sometimes it causes problems with your stomach, and sometimes you need to get rid of what's in your stomach, even if you don't want to.
A "airsickness bag," then, is a paper bag that you find usually in the seat in front of you ? in the pocket on the back of the seat in front of you that you can use in case you're going to be sick.
But of course on this airplane, the flight attendant tells Hal they're out of airsickness bags!
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
