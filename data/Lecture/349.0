The last time I went to the doctor for a checkup , she told me that I needed to start taking some dietary supplements that had the vitamins and minerals that my body needed to stay healthy. 
I told her that I ate a balanced diet , but she said that many people who generally ate well still didn't get the nutrients their bodies needed every day, and that's why she recommends taking a multivitamin. 
I remember taking chewable vitamins when I was a kid, but as an adult, I never thought I needed it. 
It wasn't because I had any signs of deficiency , she said, but that it was better to be safe than sorry . 
I asked if it was possible to overdose on over-the-counter multivitamins, and she said that it was highly unlikely if I followed the recommended dosage . 
She said that most people's bodies are able to tolerate and absorb the multivitamins without any problems. 
As I get older, she said, it's all the more important to take care of myself. 
She's right, of course. 
I shouldn't neglect my health. 
I just wonder if I can find some of those chewable vitamins in the shape of my favorite cartoon characters. 
I may be an adult, but I don't always have to act like one!
