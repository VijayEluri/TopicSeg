Our dialogue begins with Wei saying to Jason, "What's wrong?
You look like you're in pain" ? you look like you're having some painful experience.
Jason says, "My stomach is acting up again."
When we say something is "acting up," we mean it's not working correctly.
In this case, his stomach is causing him pain.
You can also use the verb "to act up" when we are talking about a machine: "My car is acting up again."
If a person is "acting up," especially a young child, we mean that that child is causing problems ? yelling, fighting, screaming, et cetera.
So, to "act up" has those different meanings.
Jason says, "My stomach is acting up" ? it's causing me pain.
Wei says, "It's all of this stress."
"Stress" is the feeling of being worried, nervous, and anxious, usually because you have a lot of responsibilities or things that you have to do ? a lot of pressure.
Wei says, "I don't know how anyone can cope with the pressures you're under."
To "cope" (cope) means to be able to manage a difficult situation, to be able to succeed when things are very difficult.
Wei says, "I don't know how anyone can cope with the pressures you're under."
"Pressure," in this case, means things that you need to do, but that are difficult and make you feel worried, nervous, and anxious.
"I'm under a lot of pressure" is the expression we would use ?
I have a lot of things that people want me to do and that I have to do.
Jason says, "It's nothing (meaning I don't have that many problems).
I'll just take a pill for my stomach" ? a pill that has medicine that will help my stomach.
Wei says, "That won't solve the problem (that won't end the problem).
Look at you.
You look worn out."
When someone says "look at you," they're saying there's something wrong with you; you need to realize something that you are not realizing yet.
"You look worn out," Wei says.
To be "worn (worn) out" is when you are very tired, when you're exhausted.
"I was playing with my five-year-old nephew, and now I'm worn out" ?
I'm very tired; he has a lot of energy, and I, as you know, am an old man...or, getting older!
Wei says, "Are you losing sleep, too?"
To "lose sleep" means to not be able to sleep at night, usually because you are under a lot of stress ? under a lot of pressure.
There's an expression, "I'm not going to lose any sleep over it," which means I'm not going to worry about it; it's not going to bother me.
Here, Wei is asking, "Are you losing sleep?"
Jason says, "I have had trouble sleeping."
Wei says, "It's no wonder."
When we say something is "no wonder," we mean it's not surprising; it's not unexpected.
She says, "At home, you have the demands of raising two kids on your own."
The "demands" are the things that Jason has to do.
He has many things in raising his two kids on his own, meaning there's no mother or wife at home; he is the only one who is helping the children grow up.
She continues, "at work, you're in a dog-eat-dog environment everyday."
The expression "dog-eat-dog" means very competitive ? very aggressive.
Someone says, "This is a dog-eat-dog business," they mean it's a very difficult business; there's a lot of competition; a lot of people trying to do better than the other people.
Jason says, "I have to admit that my nerves are shot, but what can I do?"
Your "nerves," here, are your feelings of being anxious, worried, and stressed.
We have another expression "to get on someone's nerves."
It means to make them feel anxious or worried ? to bother them.
Jason says his "nerves are shot."
When we say something is "shot," we mean it's worn out; it's tired; it doesn't work anymore correctly.
"Shot" has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Wei says, "Maybe we can work something out."
To "work something out" is an expression that means to be able to find a solution for a problem ? to find a way to be able to do something.
Wei says, "To start, how about if I watch your kids for a few hours this weekend so you can get some rest?"
Wei is offering to go over and take care of Jason's two children, so Jason can have some time to rest and not worry about taking care of the children.
Jason says, "I couldn't ask you to do that," meaning no, it's not right for me to ask you to do that.
He says, "You have to take care of your own kids."
Wei has children that she has to take care of.
Wei says, "So, what's two more?" meaning having two more children will not be a problem for me.
Jason replies, "If you really don't mind (if it's really not a problem), I'll take you up on that."
To "take someone up on something" means to accept someone's offer, to agree to do what someone else has suggested to you.
Usually it's when someone is offering to help you.
Jason says, "I could use a breather."
A "breather" (breather) is a break; a rest; a short period of time when you don't have to do anything.
If you're working very hard with someone, you might say, "Let's take a breather" ? let's take a break; let's stop working for a short time so we can rest.
Wei says, "It's set, then," meaning okay, we've agreed.
"Here," she says, "take one of these pills" ? for Jason's stomach, we can guess.
She says, "If it doesn't kill you, it'll make you stronger."
This is sort of a funny expression: "if it doesn't kill you, it'll make you stronger" ? it will make you stronger.
It means that things that are difficult often help people be better, as long as they're not too difficult.
Jason says, "Thanks!"
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
