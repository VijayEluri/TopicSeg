Alberto, can I pick your brain for a minute? 
Yeah, sure, but you'll have to make it quick. 
I'm going into a meeting at 3. 
Sure. 
Hopefully, this won't take long. 
I'm thinking about asking for a raise. 
I've been working here for a year and half, and I now have a lot more responsibilities on my plate than when I started. 
I think I've earned a raise, but I don't know how to broach the issue with Wayne. 
I can't just go into his office and say, "Give me a raise!" 
You're right. 
It's not an easy thing to bring up. 
One thing I did when I asked for a raise last year was to remind Wayne of my qualifications and all of the work I do around here. 
I tried to convince Wayne that I was indispensable. 
Obviously it worked. 
You got a raise and a promotion, too. 
All I want is a bump in pay. 
The trick is to sell yourself without seeming self-serving. 
And, you don't want to give any ultimatums either. 
That definitely won't fly with Wayne. 
I can see that. 
I plan to talk to him at the end of the week so wish me luck. 
You don't need it. 
I'm sure Wayne will see things your way.
