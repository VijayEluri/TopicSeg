Can we talk? 
Uh-huh. 
I don't think we communicate very well. 
We don't talk to each other like we used to. 
I think we need to have a dialogue about these dysfunctional communication patterns. 
Hmm. 
I think we need to work on our relationship. 
We have a strong foundation , but we have problems relating to each other. 
Oprah says... 
Hold on! 
Is this something you saw on the Oprah show? 
Well, yes, it is. 
Oprah did a show about how couples grow apart after years of being together, and good communication is the cornerstone of a good relationship. 
Being a sympathetic listener and validating each other's feelings are very important. 
Stop right there. 
I'll make you a deal. 
I'll communicate more with you, but you have to promise not to bring up Oprah again. 
I don't want a talk show host telling me how to run my life. 
She's more than a talk show host. 
She's... 
I mean it. 
I'm putting my foot down. 
No more Oprah. 
Okay? 
Okay, if that's how you feel about it. 
It is. 
That's fine, but I wonder what Dr. Phil would say about your hostile feelings toward Oprah. 
Uh!
