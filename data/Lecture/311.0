I think my husband is going through a mid-life crisis. 
What makes you think that? 
He just traded in his car for a very expensive sports car, and he's filling the house with gym equipment. 
Uh oh, that's a bad sign. 
Do you know what may have triggered this? 
I'm not sure, but he was passed over for a promotion at work a couple of months ago, and his new boss is 15 years younger than he is. 
That would do it. 
What really worries me is that he's been talking about quitting his job altogether and becoming a full-time writer. 
He always wanted to become a successful writer. 
That's sounds familiar. 
When my brother went through a mid-life crisis, he spent a lot of time reflecting on his life and regretting giving up music to get a full-time job. 
He saw himself as being washed up and he was fed up with everything. 
What did he do? 
Well, he's probably not a good example of what your husband would do. 
Don't beat around the bush. 
Just tell me. 
Well, if you must know, he got a divorce, married a woman half his age, and tried to start a rock band. 
Oh, no! That's just what I was afraid of. 
I'm sure that won't happen with your husband. 
You two have a great marriage. 
I thought so, too, but you never know.
