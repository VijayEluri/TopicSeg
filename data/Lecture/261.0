Oh, are those pictures of your kids? 
Yes. 
These are my three daughters and these are my two sons. 
Your sons look so alike. 
Are they similar in personality , too? 
It's funny you ask that. 
My wife and I are always saying how different they are from one another, even though they're the closest in age . 
Sergey, the younger one, is moody and a little timid , while his older brother, Dennis, is talkative and cheerful all the time. 
That's really interesting. 
You know, I have an older sister and we're only a year apart, but we have very different personalities, too. 
When I was little, I was bad-tempered and I always fought with my brothers and sisters, while my sister was a little angel. 
She was always patient and generous . 
I really looked up to her. 
It's hard for me to believe that you were ever bad-tempered. 
You're so even-keeled now. 
Me, on the other hand, I was a selfish and stubborn kid. 
I'm surprised that my parents put up with me. 
I'm sure you're exaggerating . 
All kids are a little selfish and stubborn, I think. 
Good thing most of us grow out of it as we get older. 
Well, that may be true, but according to my wife and kids, I'm still the most stubborn person in the world. 
They may be right.
