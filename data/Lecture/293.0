Look at that couple over there. 
What they're doing is indecent! 
Where? 
Oh, you mean those two people hugging and kissing ? 
That's not indecent. 
They're not just hugging and kissing. 
That girl is sitting on her boyfriend's lap and they're making out in the middle of a public place. 
They need to get a room . 
They're just passionate , and there's nothing wrong with that. 
Don't you remember when you were a teenager in love? 
When I was a teenager, we behaved a lot more modestly . 
We might hold hands or give each other a peck on the cheek in public. 
That's it. 
Anything else we did, we did in private . 
Oh, you're not saying that you didn't get cozy with your boyfriend as a teenager, you're just saying you did it in private. 
Right. 
What I object to is having to watch other people's public displays of affection . 
It turns my stomach . 
Don't look now , but there's another PDA over there. 
Oh, no!
