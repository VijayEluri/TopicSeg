Can I help you? 
I'm looking for an MP3 player, but I don't know a lot about them. 
We have a large selection, as you can see. 
Wow, I really don't know where to begin. 
What do you want to be able to do? 
I just want something small and portable that I can use to listen to music that I rip from CDs. 
I also want to be able to download songs off the Internet. 
Most of the players you see here can do that. 
One thing you have to watch out for is that some music websites are proprietary. 
That means that you can only listen using certain types of players. 
That's what I'm worried about. 
Well, this one plays music in a lot of different file formats and is compatible with most of the major music download sites, both proprietary and open-source. 
It comes with an FM tuner, a built-in battery charger, and good quality headphones. 
What about it's storage capacity and charge time? 
It has 30 gigabytes of memory and can hold about 7,500 songs. 
You get about 15 hours of music playback on one charge and it charges up in about four hours. 
It has a nice screen, too, that's backlit. 
It looks like what I've been looking for. 
I'll take it.
