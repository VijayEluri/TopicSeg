Thanks for meeting with me. 
It's my pleasure. 
We're eager to hear your ideas about our companies doing business together in the future. 
Well, I wanted us to meet because I think our two companies can create great synergy . 
I agree. 
What do you have in mind ? 
We seem to have core capabilities that complement each other, and I want to see how we can create a partnership that would be to our mutual benefit . 
Yes, that's why I'm here. 
I think we're thinking along the same lines . 
Good. 
I'm glad to hear that. 
If we can pull off a partnership, we could really dominate the market. 
Yes, I think that's true, too, but let's get beyond the preliminaries . 
What kind of business model do you have in mind? 
Well, that's why I wanted to meet with you. 
I'd like to get your perspective on that. 
I see. 
When your company approached us about working together, we were under the impression that you had some concrete ideas to present. 
Oh, we do. 
I just wanted to get your suggestions before we present a formal proposal . 
Let's do this. 
Why don't you send me a proposal in writing and I'll make sure that we give it our full consideration . 
We'll do that. 
Thanks for your time. 
Don't mention it.
