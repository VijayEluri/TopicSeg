Excuse me, where is the restroom? 
It's down the hall, on your left. 
Thanks. 
When I got into the bathroom, it was a mess . 
I walked into a stall and there was toilet paper all over the floor. 
There were no toilet seat covers and the toilet wouldn't flush . 
Even the toilet seat was broken! 
I gave up on the stall and decided to use a urinal . 
I went to wash my hands, but there was no soap in the dispenser . 
I kept hitting the pump , but nothing came out. 
When I turned on the faucet , water splashed all over my pants. 
I looked for some paper towels to dry myself, but they were out . 
I tried using one of the hand dryers , but that was broken, too. 
I couldn't believe what a mess this bathroom was. 
I just thought, what happened here? 
World War III?
