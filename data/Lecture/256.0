Ugh! 
What's the matter? 
I'm trying to jot down some ideas for the meeting tomorrow but I'm drawing a blank. 
When I've got a block, I usually step away from it for a while and come back to it later. 
Then I can look at it with a fresh perspective. 
I don't have time to take a break. 
I need to come up with something quick or I'll have to go into that meeting empty-handed. 
I can't let Danielle show me up again. 
At the last meeting, all of the department heads loved her ideas and they're starting to think she walks on water. 
Well, I don't think it helps to sit around worrying about it. 
Nothing will come to you if you work yourself up too much. 
You're right. 
I'm too wound up to think straight. 
It's like my brain is in a fog. 
Come on. 
We'll go take a quick walk. 
I'm sure that'll do the trick. 
If it doesn't, I'll help you work on your resume. 
Gee, thanks. 
I've known all along that you're after my job. 
Me? 
After your job? 
I wouldn't touch your job with a 10-foot pole. 
I couldn't take the pressure. 
I prefer being a lowly employee and giving you a hard time everyday. 
Thanks a lot. 
Between you and Danielle, my days here are numbered. 
Come on. 
Let's go before you get even more depressed!
