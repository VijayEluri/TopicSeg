I was in a department meeting and our manager was asking for our feedback on improving our product. 
I had a few ideas and I wanted to get them across, but one of my colleagues was giving me a hard time. 
In my opinion, I think that we need to look at the question more from the customer's perspective. 
I really feel we need to do more market research. 
I tend to think that we have enough information already and it's time to make some decisions. 
Well, the way I see it, we've only scratched the surface in getting to know our customers. 
We need to get inside their heads if we want to offer what they want and aren't getting right now. 
You may be right, but if you ask me, I just don't think it's worth it to sink more time and money into the type of market research you're proposing. 
It's far more than what other companies are doing. 
That's precisely my point. 
I'm sure that if we can get information that other companies don't have, we'll be one step ahead. 
That's when the manager stepped in and offered her opinion. 
And, I'm happy to say, she sided with me.
