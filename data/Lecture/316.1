This episode discusses an email and some of the abbreviations that we use in an email or a letter.
"Abbreviations" are letters that "stand for," or take the place of, words.
We use abbreviations to save time in our writing.
Some abbreviations we also use even when we talk to each other, but for the most part, abbreviations are used in writing.
In this email, we begin with Luis saying to Sam, "Dear Sam, I am writing to follow up on (or to continue the action on) our (planned) phone conversation re: the upcoming meeting."
"Re" with a colon after it ?a "colon" is when you have one period on top of another period, what looks like a period (":") ?
"re:" means regarding, related to, or on the subject of.
When it is in the middle of a letter, it is normally not capitalized.
You will usually see "re:" in a letter or a memo at the top of the letter or memo, or right before the actual text of the letter or memo; there it is capitalized (Re:).
So, Luis says, "I am writing to follow up on our phone conversation" regarding "the upcoming meeting.
We've made good headway in our planning."
To "make headway" (headway ? one word) means to make progress, to advance.
To "make headway" is the process of moving a project forward; doing the next thing that has to be done.
Luis says, "We've made good headway in our planning having settled many of the arrangements."
"Settled" here means having planned, having arranged, or simply having decided.
So they've "settled," or decided on, "many of the arrangements, e.g."; "e.g." stands for the Latin expression "exempli gratia," or "grazia," this means "for example," or "for instance" ?
"e.g."
So, Luis says we've settled on "many of the arrangements," for example, "the date, time, and venue."
A "venue" (venue) is the place or location where some event or some activity, some meeting will take place.
"However," Luis says, "we still need to decide on the agenda."
Your "agenda" (agenda) is a list of things that you will be discussing in a meeting, usually the order in which you'll be discussing these topics.
"However, we still need to decide on the agenda, i.e."; "i.e." stands for, again, a Latin expression, "id est," and it means "in other words," or "that is."
So, Luis is saying, "we still need to decide on the agenda," that is, "who will speak, in what order, and for what length of time."
"I.e." is similar to "e.g."
When you use "e.g.," you're giving an example of something; when you're using "i.e.," you're giving an additional definition, if you will, of that word.
So, Luis is explaining that when he says "agenda," he means the order of the speakers and the length of time they will be speaking.
When he talks about the arrangements, he uses "e.g." because he's giving an example of some of the arrangements they have settled on ? they have already decided on.
Luis continues, "Fortunately, we have free rein to set up the meeting as we see fit."
"Free rein" (rein ? two words) means freedom to do what you want, the ability to make decisions on your own.
Someone may say to you, "You have free rein on this project, do whatever you want."
That means you can make all of your own decisions.
"My wife has free rein for deciding what kind of furniture we're going to buy" ? it's her decision.
Luis says that "we have free rein to set up the meeting as we see fit."
The expression "as we see fit," or "as you see fit," means as we want; as we like; we can do whatever we want.
It's very similar to "free rein."
Luis says, "it's just a matter of hammering out the details."
"It's just a matter of" means the only thing we have to do is hammer out the details.
The phrasal verb to "hammer out" means to decide or determine the final details of something, usually an agreement, or in this case, a meeting.
"We need to hammer out the details" ? we need to figure out all of the little things that need to be done.
Luis says they need to hammer "out the details before we can invite the participants" ? the people coming to the meeting ? before we can "book" the room, or reserve "the meeting room, etc."
At the end, he says, "etc."
"Etc." is another Latin abbreviation for the words "et cetera."
"Et cetera" is abbreviated "etc.," and it means that we are saying the list that we are giving is not complete, that there are other things that we could add to this list of things.
In this case, Luis is saying that the details include inviting the participants, booking the room, and other things.
But he doesn't want to list every single thing, so to let Sam know that there are other things in addition, he uses the abbreviation "etc."
Luis suggests that they "call a second meeting and invite some of the people who will be involved in the (main) meeting."
And then he lists some names, "Adam, Lin, Toshi, Cecelia, et al."
"Et al.," spelled E-T A-L.
(two different words ?
"et" and then space "al."), is, again, a Latin expression which means "and others."
The Latin expression is "et alii."
We use "etc."
(etc.) when we are talking about things in a list, we use "et al." when we are talking about people.
So, instead of giving all the names of the people, Luis says, "Adam, Lin, Toshi, Cecelia, et al.," meaning there are other people on the list.
English, as you can see, uses a lot of Latin words ? abbreviations for Latin words ? in its writing.
Luis says, "With everyone there (with everyone at the meeting), we should be able to come to a decision about the remaining issues."
The "remaining issues" are the things that haven't been finished yet.
"If this is in line with your thinking, I'll send out an email ASAP."
The expression "to be in line (line) with someone's thinking" means that you are in agreement; you have the same opinion.
The abbreviation "ASAP" stands for "as soon as possible" ? as soon as you can.
Sometimes people will say "a sap," but mostly we say "ASAP."
These letters are usually capitalized, without periods in between them.
Notice for the other abbreviations, the Latin abbreviations especially, we tend to use periods, but for "ASAP," there are usually no periods and all the letters are capitalized.
Finally, Luis says, "P.S."
(P.S.).
This is an abbreviation for "post script."
It's used at the end of a letter or the end of the message to add some additional information.
It is always put underneath the name of the person, so you have a letter or an email, on the bottom you put your name, then you want to say something else, you can say "P.S."
If you write an email to your wife, you may tell her "I will be home tonight at 5:00," and then you put your name, and below your name you put "P.S. I love you."
Isn't that nice!
Luis says, "P.S. We also need to start planning the annual meeting, but we can wait until this one is wrapped up before we start on that."
To "wrap (wrap) up something" is a phrasal, or two-word verb, meaning to finish; to complete; to end.
To "wrap up" also has some additional definitions; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations about that.
Now let's listen to the story, this time at a normal speed.
