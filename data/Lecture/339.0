What do you plan to do? 
I don't know! 
I can't defy my parents. 
They've been against our relationship from the start, and I've been forbidden to see you. 
It's your life, not theirs. 
It's time you stood up to them and told them what you want. 
I'm tired of being a puppet in the feud between your family and mine. 
That's easy to say, but I can't confront my father and tell him that I want to be with you. 
It would kill him! 
No, it won't. 
He's using guilt to get you to give me up. 
Don't let him manipulate you that way. 
This is tearing me apart. 
I can't take it much longer. 
You won't have to. 
I'm leaving ? without you. 
No! You can't. 
I can't live without you. 
Someday, we'll be together... Cut! 
Where is the director? 
This is supposed to be the story about star-crossed lovers, not a trashy melodrama. 
Whoever wrote this trash should be fired!
