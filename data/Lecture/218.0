Hey, Henry. 
You look busy. 
What's that you're reading? 
Oh, hi, Jane. 
I'm studying the driver's manual so I can finally get my driver's license. 
I just hope I can remember all these traffic laws. 
I'm sure you'll pass the tests with flying colors, especially since you can miss a few and still pass. 
Just don't forget to bring your glasses with you so you don't fail the vision test. 
Yeah, I know. 
I think the written test will be okay, but I'm really worried about the road test. 
I never took driver's ed and I'm nervous behind the wheel. 
My brother failed his test the first time because he forgot to signal a left turn, and then he didn't yield to a pedestrian. 
He also screwed up on the parallel parking. 
It sounds like he just got nervous. 
A busy intersection is always tricky. 
So when's your appointment at the DMV? 
Next Tuesday. 
But I might just go in earlier and take the test as a walkin. 
Can't wait, huh? 
Well, I'll let you get back to studying. 
Good luck! 
Thanks. 
See you around.
