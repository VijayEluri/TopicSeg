Our dialogue begins with Marjorie saying, "I wish I could have been there when you told the managers that you were leaving the company and starting your own business!"
"I wish I could have been there" means I wanted to be there, I wish that had happened.
It didn't happen, I wasn't there, is the idea.
Pedro says, "Everyone was taken aback."
"To be taken aback" means to be surprised and shocked, often in a very negative way.
"When I told him that his son was not going to be able to go to the university, he was taken aback" ? his father was taken aback.
We have several common ways of using the word "taken" plus some other preposition, for example: "taken over."
Take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of these expressions with "taken."
Pedro says, "Everyone was taken aback.
Dan gave me a dirty look, of course."
"To give someone a dirty look" means to make an expression with your face that shows that you are angry with them or you are unhappy with them.
It's a very negative way of describing what someone does.
"She gave me a dirty look" ? she looked at me like she was angry or mad.
Pedro says that Dan is always looking "down his nose at me."
"To look down your nose at someone" means to believe that you are better, smarter, or more intelligent than another person.
"He looked down his nose at me" ? he thought I was not as good as he was.
"As for Sanjaya," Pedro says, "if looks could kill."
The expression "if looks could kill" is used to mean that someone made a very angry facial expression.
If facial expressions were able to kill people, this one would have done so ? that's the idea.
So, the expression "if looks could kill" means something similar to giving someone a dirty look; they gave you a very angry expression.
Marjorie says, "Sanjaya?
I thought if anyone would understand why you wanted to strike out on your own, he would."
Marjorie is saying that Sanjaya should have understood why Pedro wanted to strike out on his own.
"To strike out on your own" means to begin to do something independently, without the help of other people.
Often, we use this expression when someone is starting a new business for example, or is going to move away from home and live in their own apartment ? they're going to strike out on their own.
The expression "to strike out" has several meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations of that.
Marjorie continues, "I honestly don't know (Sanjaya) that well, but I thought he was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy."
The expression "happy-go-lucky" means relaxed, very calm.
We might say "laid back," not excited about anything.
Someone who is happy-go-lucky never gets angry, never gets sad, is always very relaxed.
I am not happy-go-lucky, in case you were wondering!
Pedro says, "Maybe I misread him."
"To misread" someone or something means to misinterpret, to see something that you think is one thing but is actually something else ? when you misunderstand a situation.
You can misread a person, you can also misread a situation.
It's more common probably to say "I misread that person."
Pedro says, "I misread (Sanjaya)" meaning my opinion about him was wrong, I was wrong.
"He certainly wasn't grinning ear to ear."
"To grin" (grin) means to smile.
"To grin from ear to ear" means to have a very big smile, to smile very widely.
Pedro is saying that Sanjaya was not smiling, "He just had a frown on his face the entire time."
A "frown" (frown) is the opposite of a smile.
When you are showing someone that you are not happy, you have a frown on your face.
Marjorie then asks about Wendy.
Pedro says, "I'm not sure (I don't know) what to make of her reaction."
"What to make of" means how to understand or how to interpret something.
"I don't know what to make of the news that there are now more people the United States who drink coffee for breakfast than Coca-Cola for breakfast."
Believe it or not, there are a million people in the U.S. that drink Coca-Cola for breakfast, at least that's the last statistic that I heard.
"I don't know what to make of it" ?
I don't know how to interpret it, I don't know what it means.
Pedro says, "She just raised her eyebrows at me."
"To raise your eyebrows at someone" means to lift that part of your face that is about your eye, what we call your "eyebrow."
You have hair above your eye that you can move up and down.
"To lift your eyebrows at someone" means that you are confused or surprised by something that that person has said.
"She sort of winced when I broke the news."
"To wince" (wince) is to change your facial expression to show a very negative emotion: surprise, pain, shock.
Often, you move your head and shoulders back a little when you wince.
It shows that you are sort of in pain or you are very surprised in a bad way about something.
Pedro says Wendy "winced when I broke the news (when I told her the news that I was leaving)."
Then he says Wendy "had a poker face."
To have a "poker (poker) face" means that you do not show your emotions; no one can tell what you are really thinking or feeling.
"Poker," you may know, is a popular game with playing cards.
If you go to Las Vegas, you can play poker.
The expression "poker face" means that you don't show any expression, because when you play poker, you don't want to let the other players know what cards you have.
I'm a terrible poker player because I do not have a poker face; you know exactly what I'm thinking by looking at my face.
That's why I can never lie to my wife; she'll always know the truth.
That's a good thing, I think!
Marjorie says that the last time Wendy was mad at her, "she was purple with rage."
The expression "to be purple with rage" (rage) means to be very angry, so angry that your face turns red.
"Purple" is a color ? a dark color.
"Rage" is when you are very angry.
So, "purple with rage" means your face turns red ? turns something like the color purple because you are so angry.
Marjorie then asks Pedro "aren't you happy about your big announcement?
I don't get it (I don't understand).
Why the long face?"
A "long face" is when you are disappointed or sad about something.
"Why the long face" ? why are you disappointed or why are you unhappy.
Pedro says, "I just wonder if I did the right thing by making an announcement, rather than telling each manager individually."
He got everyone together as a group and told them he was leaving the company.
Now he thinks he should have talked to each manager separately.
Pedro says, "I thought it would feel good to spring it on them all at once, but now I'm doubting whether I did the right thing."
"To spring something on someone" means to surprise someone with something, to tell her or him surprising news without giving them any warning, without them expecting it.
Someone may say, "I hate to spring this on you, but can you give me your car this afternoon to use?"
You're surprising them by asking them for this.
Pedro says, "I thought it would feel good to spring it on them all at once," meaning altogether, all at one time.
Marjorie says, "It's no use crying over spilled milk."
"To cry over spilled milk" is to worry about something that has already happened and that you can't change.
Don't cry over milk that you have spilled ? that you have let fall on the floor or on the table by accident, it's no use, it doesn't help you.
You also hear this expression "don't cry over spilt milk"; the past of spill can either be either "spilled" (spilled) or "spilt" (spilt).
In either case, you don't want to worry about things you can't change.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
