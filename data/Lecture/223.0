Here's the bill for your four-night stay . 
Would you like the incidentals charged to your credit card? 
Incidentals? 
I think there's some mistake. 
I didn't order any pay-per-view movies and I never ordered room service . 
And, I didn't have any spa services , either. 
Are you sure? 
We show three movies and two room service orders. 
I'm positive. 
Could I speak to a supervisor, please? 
He's not on duty right now, but let me see if I can resolve this for you. 
How many of these charges were made in error? 
All of them. 
Is it possible that my bill was switched with another room's? 
As I said, I didn't order any movies, I haven't had any room service, and I haven't visited the spa since I checked in to the hotel. 
I see. 
I'll need to check with each of those departments to determine whether a mistake has been made. 
How long will this take? 
Not long, I'm sure. 
If you could take a seat in the lobby ... 
I have a plane to catch and I don't have a lot of time. 
Is there a general manager I can speak to? 
I'm not sure. 
If you'll have a seat, I'll see if I can get Ms. Cardenes for you. 
Thank you. 
I'd appreciate it.
