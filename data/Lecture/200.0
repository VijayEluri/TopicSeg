You wanted to see me? 
Yes, I did. 
Have a seat. 
I want to talk to you about the Pulsen project. 
I know I'm a little late in getting that report to you, but I've been pulling out the stops to get it done. 
But it's still not done, is it? 
You know that the deadline for the next milestone of the project was this past Monday. 
Yes, I know, but the scope of the project turned out to be a lot bigger than I had anticipated . 
And, they just didn't allocate enough resources for something this size. 
Is there any way we can push back the deadline by a week? 
The time to ask that was last week, not after you've missed the deadline . 
I have the management breathing down my neck about this report. 
I've tried to stall them for the past two days and they're not happy. 
I promise to have it on your desk by tomorrow morning. 
You have my word. 
All right. 
I'll give you until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. 
I'm tired of taking the heat , though, and I don't plan to do it any longer. 
You can count on me. 
Don't let me down . 
I won't.
