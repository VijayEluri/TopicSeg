I got our lottery tickets during my lunch break. 
The jackpot is up to $168 million dollars. 
Imagine if we won. 
Thanks for getting mine, too. 
When is the drawing? 
Saturday at 6 PM. 
It's being televised on Channel 4. 
What would you do if you had $168 million dollars? 
The first thing I would do is quit my job! 
No more slaving away for me. 
What would you do? 
If I were rich, I would travel around the world. 
If I were younger, I'd learn how to fly a plane. 
I've always wanted to do that. 
It's never too late. 
You could still do that. 
You can't teach an old dog new tricks. 
I'd probably just retire and buy myself a nice new house. 
Yeah, that sounds nice. 
I suppose I'd have a lot of family and friends asking for money. 
I know I would. 
I can just see them coming out of the woodwork and pestering me. 
Maybe winning the lottery isn't such a good thing. 
You're right. 
It's a curse. 
When you win, you can give me all of the money. 
Yeah, right. 
Don't hold your breath!
