Look at this! 
The president of McQuillan University is stepping down . 
He submitted his resignation this morning after an undergraduate student made allegations that they had an affair and that she's pregnant with his baby. 
That's terrible. 
Maybe they were in love. 
In love? 
He's married and has four kids, and when she first went public about the affair, he denied it and said that she had made up the whole story . 
Would someone in love try to cover up something like this? 
Who knows? 
The president of a major university is a person with a lot to lose . 
I'm not making excuses for him, but maybe he lost his head . 
Of course he had a lot to lose. 
Anyone who is in the public eye like he is shouldn't be playing with fire . 
He's an embarrassment to his family and to his university. 
I still think there could be extenuating circumstances . 
All you know you've learned from one newspaper article. 
That much is true, but I know one thing 
Whatever happens to him, it serves him right !
