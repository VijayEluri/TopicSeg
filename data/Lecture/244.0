Have you had a chance to look over Russ's project? 
Yeah, I took a look at it yesterday. 
If you have a couple of minutes, I can give you my two cents. 
Sure. 
Shoot. 
Well, it's not what I envisioned when we gave him the charge to come up with a new design for the brochure. 
The cover isn't bad, but I'm not crazy about the rest of it. 
Why? 
What don't you like? 
Well, I think Russ is off the mark to feature our older products, rather than our new ones. 
When I saw what he had come up with , I thought he was out in left field. 
We told him to focus on the latest products, didn't we? 
Yes, we did tell him that. 
I haven't had a chance to look at the brochure closely myself, but I plan to this afternoon. 
So you think it needs work, huh ? 
A lot of work? 
Let's just say that there's a lot of room for improvement. 
I'd be happy to meet with him to give him my comments , if you think that would help. 
Why don't you hold off until I've had a chance to go over the brochure this afternoon. 
I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow and we can both give him some feedback on how to proceed. 
That's okay with me. 
Thanks for taking the reins on this. 
It's no big deal . 
I'll let you know later today about that meeting.
