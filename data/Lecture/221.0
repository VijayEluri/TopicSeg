I met Diana last year when we were both working in New York City for the summer. 
I'm finishing college in California and Diana started her first job in Florida. 
Talk about a bicoastal relationship! 
We spent three great months together and we've been trying to maintain a long distance relationship ever since. 
It's been really hard and I had a talk about it with my friend, Emily, who just got out of a relationship like this. 
I'm always worried that for her, it's out of sight, out of mind. 
I know what you mean, but is it that way with you? 
No, not at all. 
I think about her all the time. 
It's not that there aren't temptations, but I'm committed to Diana. 
Don't you get the same vibe from her? 
Sometimes I do, but a lot of times I don't. 
It's so easy to get into a fight on the phone. 
We have misunderstandings all the time or I hurt her feelings without realizing it. 
And plus, I'm still in school and she's already out working, and it seems like we're growing apart. 
That's what happened with Theo and me. 
We grew apart and we had less and less in common. 
After a year, we called it quits. 
I hope that's not what Diana wants. 
I've got to have it out with her. 
If she wants to end this, then I'll just have to deal with it. 
It's always better to know where you stand. 
Let me know how it goes. 
Sure. 
See you later.
