I don't like cats. 
That's not really true. 
I like cats, but they don't like me. 
Last week, my friend Sara asked me to babysit her cat for two days while she was out of town. 
Normally, I would have said no, but she was in a jam , so I said okay. 
As I said, cats don't like me. 
When I got home from work, I couldn't find her. 
I was sure she was hiding from me. 
I looked all over the house. 
I started with the bedrooms , looking in the closets and under the bed. 
I looked in the bathroom and even behind the shower curtain . 
I went downstairs and searched the basement . 
No cat. 
Next, I looked all over the living room , checking under the couch and behind the TV. 
I also looked in the pantry and then the laundry room , thinking that the cat must be hiding behind the washer or dryer . 
Still, no cat. 
Finally, I looked in the kitchen . 
There was the cat. 
She was sitting on the counter. 
Somehow she had managed to open a box of cookies and there she sat eating them all. 
When the cat saw me, she started mewing . 
I don't speak the language of cats, but I could have sworn that she was asking me for some milk!
