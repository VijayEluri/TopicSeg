The dialogue is between Franz and Helen.
Franz begins by saying, "I've just switched over (or changed over) to this program (software program) and I can't figure out how to format my document."
The verb to "format" here means to change the appearance of your document, to change the way the document looks when you print it on a piece of paper ? to change its style.
To make, for example, certain things bigger or certain things smaller; that would be part of "formatting."
Franz says, "Can you help me?" to Helen.
Helen says, "I can try.
Let's take a look" ? let's look at it.
"What do you want to do?" she asks.
Franz says, "I want to change the margins so that I can fit more on a page" ? so that I can put more on a page.
The "margins" are the white spaces on the top, the bottom, and the sides of the page.
There's normally nothing in the margins; it's empty, white space.
"Margin" has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Franz says that "I don't know how to change the default settings."
"Default" (default) are the normal settings of something on a computer.
The "settings" are the way that the program is set up ? what you get when you open the program and you don't change anything, those would be the "default settings."
Franz says, "I also want to put this section on a separate page.
Helen says, "Okay, you can adjust the margins by moving this up and down."
To "adjust" means to change, usually to make a small change in something.
"I need to adjust my schedule this morning" ?
I need to make a change in it this morning.
Helen says, "you can adjust the margins by moving this up or down," pointing to something on the computer screen, "or from side to side.
If you want this section on a separate page," she says, "just add a page break."
When you're working in Microsoft Word or other computer programs and you want a new page to start, you "insert," or put in, a "page break" that makes the document start a new page somewhere.
Franz says, "Oh, I see.
What if I want to add a footer or a header?"
In a word processing, or typing documents like Microsoft Word, the "header" is the space at the very top of the page, the head is at the top of your body; the "footer" is at the bottom of this page, just like your feet are at the bottom of your body.
The call those the "header" and the "footer."
These are usually the places where you put the page number, for example, and perhaps some other information.
Helen says, to answer Franz's question, "You go to this pull-down menu and select the header and footer option."
A "pull-down menu" is when you click on something on a computer program or on a web page and you get a list, and you go through the list and you pick, or select, one of the things on the list.
A "menu" is a list of options.
Helen says, "Then, you can type in the text you want.
If you want to add a page number, just insert (or put in) one by selecting it from this menu."
Franz says, "That seems easy (that appears to be easy).
What if I want to change the font?"
The "font" (font) is the style of letters ? it's the style that the letters are made in, the shape of the individual letters.
For example, in many computer programs you can select Times Roman, or Times New Roman.
That's the name of the font; that's the way that the letters look.
Another popular font would be Arial (Arial); another popular font would be Helvetica.
All of these are fonts that you find on a computer program and on a web page.
Helen answers Franz's question by saying, "You can change the font style or size (how big the letters are) by selecting the text and then making the change on the toolbar.
See?"
She's indicating how to do it on his computer.
A "toolbar" (toolbar ? one word) is a group related commands ? related options ? on a computer program.
Usually the toolbar is at the top of the page.
You'll often see little pictures ? little images ? that you can click on to do certain things.
For example on Microsoft Word, you can cut, you can delete, you can paste ? to put something in a document is to "paste" it ? and these all have little images ? little icons, we might call them ? in the toolbar.
So, the toolbar is the place were you can go to make changes in your document.
Franz says, "that seems simple enough," meaning that seems easy.
"I also want to change the orientation of the page.
How do I do that?" he asks.
The "orientation" is the direction of page.
It could be vertical, like most pages that you print; we would call that "portrait orientation" (portrait).
A vertical or a portrait orientation is when it is taller than it is wide; it is higher than it is wide.
The opposite of that would be a "landscape orientation."
"Landscape" (landscape ? one word) is when the piece of paper is wider than it is tall ? wider than it is high.
This is a horizontal orientation.
That is less common, the landscape orientation.
The most common orientation is vertical or portrait.
"Landscape" has a couple of meanings in English; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Helen says to Franz, "Right now your document is portrait.
To make it landscape, you need to go to the "Page Setup" and change it."
The "setup" (setup ? one word) are the settings and controls for doing something, the things you have to do, the things you have to prepare before something else can be done.
"Page Setup" is where you go and change thing for that page ? the margins, the orientation, and so forth.
Franz, again, says, "That seems pretty easy.
I think I've got it."
Helen says, "Good. Give it a try," meaning try it yourself without me.
"If you get stuck, I can help."
To "get stuck" (stuck) is a two-word, or phrasal, verb meaning not to be able to continue to do something.
You start doing something, and then you forget how to do it, or you don't know how to continue.
That's to "get stuck."
You can get stuck on your homework; you start your homework, if you are a student, you do the first page, and then you're confused.
You're lost ? you "get stuck."
Franz says, "Okay, great!
Now, can you go over again (can you review) how to change margins, insert a page break, change the page orientation, and add a footer?"
Franz, of course, is asking Helen to explain everything to him again.
Franz is what we call "not too bright" ? not too smart.
Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time at a normal speed.
