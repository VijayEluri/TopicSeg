I was telling my friend, Gina, a joke. 
I began it by saying, "An Irishman, an Englishman, and a Frenchman walk into this bar, and¡¦" 
Suddenly, Gina grabbed my arm and shook her head. 
I turned around and our coworker, Colin, was standing right behind me. 
Oh, hi Colin. 
I didn't see you standing there. 
I guess you didn't. 
I was just telling Gina a joke... 
Yes, I know. 
I heard. I can't believe you're telling off-color jokes, especially at work. 
I'm really sorry. 
Please don't be offended. 
I didn't intend to insult you. 
I know that you're from Ireland. 
It was just a joke. 
It may be just a joke to you, but it's getting a little old to me. 
I already have a tough time fitting in as an outsider in this company, and I'm really tired of being the butt of jokes around here. 
Besides, ethnic jokes reinforce stereotypes. 
Please don't be angry. 
I'm trying not to be oversensitive. 
I enjoy a good joke as much as anyone, but this isn't the first time this has happened. 
The other day, someone drew a picture of me dressed as a leprechaun and put it in the break room. 
That wasn't funny, and neither is this. 
You're right. 
We're all being a little insensitive. 
As far as I'm concerned, it won't happen again. 
I accept your apology and I'll take you at your word. 
Can we shake and be friends again? 
Yeah, sure. 
I guess so.
