I can't believe I let you rope me into seeing this performance. 
It was so lame ! 
Okay, you're right, it was the pits . 
I had no idea it was going to be amateur hour . 
When I saw the ad in the paper describing this as an experimental play, I thought it might be interesting. 
Was I wrong! 
I didn't understand that play at all. 
The music, if you can call it that , was atrocious . 
How can anyone be expected to listen to that for more than three seconds without going crazy? 
I wish I could get those two hours of my life back ! 
Yeah, it's left a bad taste in my mouth , too. 
Let's go see something else. 
I want to put this whole experience behind me . 
Benjamin's Bar is having open-mic tonight. 
Do you want to check it out? 
No way! 
Wild horses couldn't drag me to another amateur show. 
How about a movie instead? 
Okay, I'd go to a movie. 
You'd better pick one, though. 
Look what happened when I was left to pick a play. 
Forget about it. 
We'll just chalk it up to temporary insanity .
