Why the long face ? 
I just heard that I won't be rehired for next year. 
That's awful ! 
What a rotten thing for the management to do. 
I'll be okay, but Monica is losing her job, too. 
Oh no, not Monica, too. 
I'm so sorry to hear that . 
Who do they think they are ? 
How can they treat us this way? 
They're management and they can do whatever they want to. 
Monica just bought a new house and I'm sure she's going to have to sell it. 
That's really too bad . 
Listen, I know you'll be dead set against the rest of us pulling together to talk to the management, but I think the time has come . 
I won't let you or anyone else around here put your jobs on the line to try to save ours. 
The management will definitely take a dim view of us workers trying to speak out . 
Just lay low and hope that you won't lose your job, too. 
I don't know what the others think, but I'm not going to take this lying down . 
If they think we're just going to sit here and take it , then they've got another thing coming !
