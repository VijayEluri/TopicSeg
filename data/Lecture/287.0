I was on my way to a restaurant to meet my date for dinner when I hit a traffic jam. 
I saw that the road was congested, but since I had to take the bridge to reach downtown, I had no choice but to stay on that road. 
The traffic was bumper-to-bumper. 
One crazy driver even tried to drive on the shoulder to get around the backup. 
But as it turns out, there wasn't any way to bypass it because the backup wasn't due to an accident, a stalled car or some rubberneckers. 
It was because of road construction and only one lane was open. 
After 25 minutes of stop-and-go traffic, I was at my wit's end. 
My date was sitting at the restaurant waiting for me and I didn't have her cell phone number. 
What's more, I was really hungry. 
Finally, I got past the road construction and was on my way again. 
I drove a little recklessly, but I had to make up for lost time. 
I really liked this girl. 
The last thing I wanted was to make her think that I stood her up!
