You'll never guess who I got an email from yesterday. 
Who? 
Diana Shultz. 
Weren't you two an item back in high school? 
So, you got an email from an old flame . 
Very interesting. 
Well, that's ancient history . 
We lost touch after we went off to college. 
What did she say in her email? 
She said she was going to be in town next month and wanted to know if I wanted to get together for dinner. 
Are you going to go? 
I don't know. 
Her email came out of the blue . 
Aren't you dying of curiosity ? 
I know I would be. 
Maybe she still has feelings for you. 
Stop it! 
It's just dinner, and I'm sure she just wants to catch up on old times , nothing more. 
I wouldn't be so sure. 
You'll go, right? 
I might as well . 
If I make an excuse , she might think I'm trying to avoid her. 
Good. 
Go and then tell me all about it afterwards. 
You know I have no social life , so I live vicariously through you. 
Stop making things up. 
You date more than anyone I know. 
Okay, I'm going, so stop pestering me. 
All right, but I can't wait to hear all about it!
