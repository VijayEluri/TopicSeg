Where is everybody? 
Excuse me? 
Were you talking to me? 
Oh, no. 
I was just talking to myself . 
Our tour group was supposed to rendezvous here at five o'clock for our return trip to the hotel. 
But there's no trace of the bus and I don't see any other people from my group anywhere. 
You know, it's 5:10. 
Maybe the bus took off already. 
That can't be! 
Our tour guide said that we would meet back here at fiveish . 
She didn't say precisely at five. 
Maybe that's what she meant. 
You know, tour guides usually stick pretty closely to a time schedule. 
Yes, I know, but what am I supposed to do now? 
I don't have any way to get back to the hotel. 
Do you have the number of the tour company ? 
I could lend you my cell phone to call them. 
Let me see. 
No, I don't. 
I feel like such an idiot ! 
Wait a second. 
Is that your bus over there? 
Where? 
Oh my gosh , I think it is! 
I must be on the wrong side of the park. 
If I make a run for it, I may be able to catch it before it takes off. 
Thanks a lot for spotting it! 
No sweat , but you'd better step on it !
