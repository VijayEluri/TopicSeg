Turn that radio down ! 
No way! 
I'm listening to a simulcast of a performance and it's live. 
Is it on campus radio? 
No, it's on the public radio station . 
I finally got good reception after putting this long antenna outside my window and I'm not turning it off now. 
You are so low-tech . 
I can't believe you're still listening to AM/FM radio . 
You should get satellite radio . 
You get shows in hundreds of formats, and there are a lot of stations without DJs . 
And there's never any static ! 
I like listening to the regular broadcast radio. 
I don't have to pay for it and I'm happy with the stations we have in this city. 
You're just a technology snob . 
If it's high-tech, you love it and have to have it. 
It's true that I know quality when I see it, and I don't settle for less. 
What's wrong with that? 
Nothing, but I don't have to jump on the bandwagon . 
Now, be quiet. 
I'm trying to listen. 
Fine. 
This is the thanks I get for trying to give you a little good advice. 
Shh!
