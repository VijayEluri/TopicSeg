Hey Dom, I haven't seen you in so long. 
Where have you been? 
Oh, I've been busy. 
I've missed hanging out together. 
How's Leslie? 
She's okay, but things haven't been that great between us. 
I'm really sorry to hear that. 
What's up? 
Leslie is great, but she's so jealous of my friends, especially my female friends. 
She doesn't like it when I see them or even if I talk to them on the phone. 
To be honest, that's why I haven't called you lately. 
I got the feeling that you've been avoiding me. 
Now I understand that it's the green-eyed monster at work. 
Have you been doing anything to make her jealous? 
No! 
I go out with my friends sometimes but I'm always up front with Leslie and tell her what I'm doing. 
But, she's so possessive. 
Even when I go out with my guy friends, she flips out sometimes. 
I don't know why she won't trust me. 
Maybe she's just insecure about herself, or maybe she feels insecure about your relationship. 
But either way, I'd stop this in its tracks before it gets any worse. 
Have you talked to her about it? 
Not really. 
We usually get into a big fight and then we make up, but we don't ever get at the root of the matter. 
I wish I could help. 
You already have. 
Talking about it helps. 
Whatever it takes, I'm going to get this under control. 
Other than this jealousy problem, we have a great relationship. 
I don't want anything to jeopardize it. 
Good luck with everything and let me know if I there's anything I can do. 
Thanks. I will.
