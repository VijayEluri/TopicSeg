We need to get these costumes sorted out. 
I'm not sure we have ones that will fit each person in this play. 
Let's see. We need a shirt for Hector. 
He's broad-shouldered, so this one would be too small. 
Any luck finding one over there? 
No, but I think I found a dress for Lee Ann. 
She's petite and thin, and I hadn't been able to find anything that would fit someone that slender. 
All of the other dresses are for women with either pear-shaped or hourglass figures. 
Okay, at least that's some progress. 
What about Malcolm? Unlike his brother who is tall and skinny, he's big and fat. 
How are we going to find one to fit him? 
He's not fat! He's stocky. 
He is really muscular and not at all flabby. 
Oh, here's a pair of pants that would fit Pierre. 
These are perfect, since he's not long-legged like all of the other men. 
We're actually doing pretty well, I think. 
We just need a costume for you. 
Me?! What do you mean? I'm not in this play. 
Oh yes, you are. Ike dropped out, so they need a replacement and you're the only one who isn't already in the play. 
Oh, no. I thought I could avoid being in the play by volunteering to help with the costumes! 
Sorry, but I don't think you can get out of it this time.
