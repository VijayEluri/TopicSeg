I went to bank this morning. 
Instead of standing in line to talk to a bank teller , I decided to use an ATM, but it wasn't working. 
Excuse me. 
Could you help me? 
I'm trying to use this ATM machine, but it stopped working after I put in my PIN and it won't give me back my ATM card. 
It looks like the machine is jammed. 
Step over to this teller window and I can help you. 
What transactions are you trying to make? 
I want to make a deposit , transfer some money between my checking and savings accounts , and make a cash withdrawal. 
I can make those transactions for you. 
Okay. 
Let me take this check out of the deposit envelope. 
And what about my card? 
I'll call the technician and she should be able to retrieve it for you. 
Thanks a lot. 
I guess that the machine just doesn't like me. 
It's not you. 
Those machines just act up sometimes. 
In that case, I won't take it personally .
