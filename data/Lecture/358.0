Aren't you supposed to be working? 
I just thought I would take a break and surf the web a little. 
You'd better be careful which sites you visit. 
You know that Big Brother is watching. 
The boss told us that, but I don't believe it. 
They're not going to care if I read a blog or check out a forum once in a while. 
That may be, but I would suggest clearing your history and your cache after you do that. 
You never know when someone is going to be checking up on you. 
Listen, I've installed plug-ins and downloaded programs I'm not supposed to onto this computer, and I've never gotten into trouble. 
I think the boss is just using scare tactics to keep us from messing around when we're supposed to be working. 
Like I said, you can dig your own grave if you want to. 
Vivian was shopping on the Internet on her work computer a couple of weeks ago, and some questionable pop-ups opened when she moved to a new tab. 
She didn't notice it, and when the boss went onto her computer to get a document while she was at lunch, he saw it. 
She was in hot water. 
Don't worry. 
I know what I'm doing. 
I know how to cover my tracks.
