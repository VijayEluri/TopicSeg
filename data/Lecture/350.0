Did you see the new movie, The McQuillan Story? 
I'm writing a movie review for the school paper. 
I went to the premiere last week. 
What did you think of it? 
I liked it. 
I thought it was entertaining , although it wasn't groundbreaking , by any means . 
You thought it was entertaining? 
I thought it was awful. 
I almost walked out . 
The acting was wooden and uninspired , and the direction was amateur . 
Aren't you being too critical ? 
It was the director's first movie and I thought his directorial debut wasn't bad. 
If there was a problem, it was with the screenplay . 
Don't get me started on the screenplay! 
The story was so predictable and the dialogue was pretentious . 
This movie is going to bomb for sure. 
Oh, I don't know. 
I think some people may enjoy it. 
If you want to do your readers a favor, you'd tell them to skip this movie and save their money!
