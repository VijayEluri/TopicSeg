Mom, I don't need a new coat. 
I like my old trench coat . 
It's comfortable, and I can use it as a raincoat and an overcoat . 
So what do I need a new coat for ? 
If you're going to visit your aunt in Maine, you'll need something warmer than a trench coat. 
This parka is nice. 
I'm not wearing a parka. 
If I'm not warm enough, I'll wear my denim jacket under my trench coat. 
That's ridiculous. 
You can't wear a jacket and a coat each time you go outside. 
Look, this down coat will keep you nice and warm. 
It has a high collar , a hood, and thick cuffs , and it's very roomy so you'll be very comfortable in it. 
It's too long. 
I don't need a knee-length coat. 
Yes, you do. 
You've never been in really cold weather and when you get there, you'll be thankful to have something so warm. 
Now, we also need to buy you a blazer . 
A blazer? 
What for? 
Your aunt is probably going to take you to some nice places and I don't want you to look like a bum . 
See? 
This one is nice and fitted . 
It's trimmed with flowers! 
Those aren't flowers. 
They're paisleys . 
You'll look very nice in it. 
Please, Mom, don't make me wear that. 
I'm begging you. 
You'll look like a nice young man in this coat and blazer. 
I'll be the laughing stock of the entire State of Maine. 
No you won't. 
Now, we need to buy you some new underwear. 
Mom! 
Shhh! 
Not so loud. 
This is so embarrassing!
