Our dialogue begins with the clerk (the employee at the store) saying, "Can I help you?"
Sandy responds, "I'm looking for an MP3 player, but I don't know a lot about them."
An "MP3 player" would be something you can use to listen to MP3 audio files.
The audio files on this podcast (and most podcasts, for example) are MP3 files.
There are many different kinds of MP3 players: the iPod is an MP3 player, Microsoft's Zune is an MP3 player; there are many others as well.
The clerk says, "We have a large selection (of these players), as you can see."
A "selection" of something is a variety of things to choose from, usually at a store.
You may say, "They have a good selection of televisions."
(They have many different kinds of televisions.)
Sandy says, "Wow, I really don't know where to begin."
(I'm confused; I'm lost; I don't know how to start the process of selecting just one of them.)
The clerk says, "What do you want to be able to do?"
(What are you going to use your MP3 player for?)
Sandy says, "I just want something small and portable."
"Portable" means small, not heavy, and easy to carry with you.
A laptop computer is portable; it's easy for you to pick up and carry with you somewhere.
Sandy wants an MP3 player that's portable that she "can use to listen to music that I rip from CDs."
The verb "to rip" (rip) in this context means to copy music from your CD onto your computer or some other device; that's to "rip a CD."
The verb "to rip" has a couple of different meanings; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Sandy goes on to say, "I also want to be able to download songs" from the Internet.
To "download" means to take certain files and put them on your computer, taking them from the Internet.
You download this podcast, for example, onto your computer.
The clerk says, "Most of the players you see here can do that.
One thing you have to watch out for (one thing you have to be careful about) is that some music websites are proprietary."
(The files they have are proprietary.)
The word "proprietary" means it belongs to a specific company or a specific person; it is made or owned by a particular person or company.
For MP3 files, or Internet files in general, when they are proprietary that usually means you can only use them on the machines that are approved by that company.
Podcasts are mostly MP3 files, they are not proprietary, but if you download music from, for example, the iTunes Music Store, those files are proprietary; you can only play them on an iPod or a computer that has iTunes software.
Of course, you can put them on a CD, but that's the general idea about proprietary formats.
The clerk explains that proprietary means "you can only listen (to those files) using certain types of players."
Sandy says, "That's what I'm worried about."
(That is what I'm concerned about.)
The clerk says, "Well, this one plays music in a lot of different file formats."
The "file format" is the way information is stored and transmitted electronically.
For example, audio files can be MP3, a picture can be a JPG (.jpg), a Microsoft Word document would be .doc; that's the file format.
The clerk says that one of the players plays "a lot of different file formats and is compatible with most of the major music download sites."
To be "compatible" means you can use it with something else with the same technology.
To be able to use two things together means that they are compatible.
The iPod is compatible with iTunes; you can use them together.
The clerk says that the players he is showing Sandy can use both proprietary files and open-source files.
"Open-source files" are ones that are free for anyone to use; it can also be software that is available for anyone to use or to change, you don't have to pay for it.
The clerk says that the MP3 player "comes with an FM tuner, a built-in battery charger, and good quality headphones."
An "FM tuner" would be something that allows you to listen to radio stations on the MP3 player.
A "built-in battery charger" is a part of the device (the machine) that allows you to recharge (or put electricity back into) a battery that is used for the equipment.
So, you usually take it and plug it into a charger so that the battery can be recharged (have enough electricity to use to power the device ? the machine).
"Headphones" are the things you put over your head or around your neck, and you put them to your ears so you can hear the music or the sound coming out of something.
Sandy says, "What about (the player's) storage capacity and charge time?"
"Storage capacity" is the expression we use to describe the amount of space that the device has to save or store files.
Your hard drive on your computer could have a storage capacity of 100 gigabytes; that's storage capacity.
"Charge time" is the amount of time it takes to recharge the battery so that the battery is, we would say, full again ? at full charge.
The word "charge" has a number of different meanings in English; again, take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
The clerk says that this MP3 player "has 30 gigabytes of memory and can hold about 7,500 songs."
(7,500 songs) He says, "You get about 15 hours of music playback on one charge."
"Playback" is when you are listening to something ? you are listening to the audio file ? so, 15 hours of listening time on one charge of the battery.
The battery "charges up," he says, "in about four hours."
So, it will be at full capacity in four hours after you start to charge it.
The MP3 player "has a nice screen," also, "that's backlit."
"Backlit" (one word ? backlit) is when the light comes from behind something; the screen is, we would say, illuminated from behind so that you can see it in the dark without having to turn on another light.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
