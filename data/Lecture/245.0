I've been trying to set up my good friend, Rachid, with one of my single girlfriends, but I still wasn't too sure what his type would be. 
So, tell me what you're looking for in a woman. 
She has to be rich and hot! 
Come on! 
Be serious. 
Okay, okay, but I don't know why married people are always trying to get their single friends married off. 
Is it because misery loves company? 
Stop being a smart aleck and answer the question. 
All right. 
I'm being serious now. 
What do I look for in a woman? 
I'd like someone who has a good sense of humor, someone who is kind-hearted and easy to talk to, and is supportive of me. 
What about vital statistics? 
Age, physical type? 
She has to be pretty, but I'm not too picky about whether she's a blond, brunette, or redhead. 
She should be my height or shorter, and around my age or a few years younger or older. 
That helps a little to narrow down who may be a good match for you. 
Any deal killers? 
I don't like women who are too chatty or who are too bossy. 
Otherwise, I have a pretty open mind when it comes to women. 
Okay, I can think of at least a couple of friends who may be willing to put up with you. 
Put up with me? 
Are you kidding? 
I'm a catch! 
Oh, geez. 
Finding somebody for you is going to be harder than I thought!
