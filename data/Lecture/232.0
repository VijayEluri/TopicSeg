I have a day job , but I recently started a small business on the side . 
I didn't know anything about accounting and my friend, Roland, said that he would give me some advice. 
So, the reason that you need to do your bookkeeping is so you can manage your cash flow . 
Even if you have a lot of orders, you may still have problems paying your bills. 
I see what you mean. 
Is this the kind of ledger I should be keeping? 
Yes, definitely. 
You want to list your debits on this side and your credits on this side. 
This will help you figure out important things like your break-even point , your assets and liabilities , your administrative expenses , and whether you're staying within your budget . 
I wish I had an accounts payable department to help me with all this. 
I don't even know how to create a balance sheet . 
It's not that hard if you use the right accounting program. 
The first thing to do is to keep track of your expenses. 
How do you do that now? 
Oh, I have a system. 
I keep all my receipts in this bag. 
Oh. 
Well, it's good that you're keeping your receipts but you'll have to keep better track of them. 
What would you do if you were audited by the IRS? 
Don't even mention the IRS! 
I've got enough problems without worrying about them!
