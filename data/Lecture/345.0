Did you hear the news? 
Nancy and Brian are splitting up . 
How long have they been married? 
Eight years. 
I'm sure it was the seven-year itch . 
I bet Brian was unfaithful to Nancy. 
How do you know? 
Maybe it was Nancy who had a wandering eye . 
Maybe, but it's a shame . 
They were such a nice couple. 
Doesn't anyone take marriage vows seriously these days? 
To me, it's a lifelong commitment . 
If you ask me, I think our notion of marriage is out of date . 
Conventional wisdom is that everybody wants to be unfaithful after they've been married a few years. 
Why not make marriage a short-term arrangement? 
In my view, a marriage should last for seven years unless you want to renew . 
If you don't, you each go your separate ways . 
You make marriage sound like an apartment contract ! 
Not everybody is as cynical as you are. 
I don't think that most couples think seriously about committing adultery , and many couples stay together for life. 
You may live in la-la land , but I live in the real world. 
If that's the real world, I don't want to live there!
