I arrived at my friend Karin's wedding a little late and the ceremony had already begun. 
I've been to a lot of civil ceremonies, but it had been a while since I had attended a religious one. 
They had asked a minister to officiate . 
When I arrived, Karin and her fianc? , Jan, were standing in front of the church. 
We are gathered here today to join Jan and Karin in holy matrimony. 
If there is anyone here who knows of a reason why these two should not be joined in marriage, speak now or forever hold your peace . 
Fortunately, no one said anything. 
Jan and Karin, please face each other and join hands. 
[To Jan] Do you, Jan Casanova, take Karin Valentine, to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold , to love and to cherish , for better and for worse, for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, ¡®till death do you part . 
Jan said, "I do," and the minister asked Karin the same question, and she said, "I do," as well. 
May I have the rings? 
[To Jan] Please place this ring, a symbol of your love, on Karin's hand and say, "With this ring, I thee wed." 
Jan put the ring on the fourth finger of Karin's left hand. 
Karin said the same thing and put a ring on Jan's finger. 
I now pronounce you husband and wife. 
You may now kiss the bride. 
Jan and Karin kissed and we all applauded . 
Ladies and gentleman, it is my great honor to present to you for the very first time the happy couple, Jan and Karin.
