The dialogue begins with Sally saying to Marcus, "Did you see the new movie, The McQuillan Story?"
Not a real movie, of course ? although it should be!
Sally says, "I'm writing a movie review for the school paper."
A "movie review" is an article in a newspaper or a magazine or a website, where someone gives their opinion about a movie ? whether it was good or bad.
Marcus says, "I went to the premiere last week."
The "premiere" is the first time that a movie is shown to the public.
In Los Angeles, there are many movies that have premieres.
A few miles from where I live, there are movie theaters where the first time the movie is shown, in that particular theater, they have a big celebration outside of the theater.
Usually in the premiere, the main actors ? the stars of the movie ?
"show up," they go to the premiere.
Sally said that she likes this movie.
She said, "I thought it was entertaining, although it wasn't groundbreaking, by any means."
She thought it was "entertaining," meaning amusing ? interesting , but it wasn't "groundbreaking."
The adjective "groundbreaking" means new , or modern , or revolutionary ? something completely different than how things were done in the past.
She says "it wasn't groundbreaking, by any means."
The expression "by any means" means at all ? in any way.
It has a couple of different meanings, this expression; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Marcus said, "You thought it was entertaining?" meaning he doesn't agree with her.
"I thought it was awful" ? it was terrible, it was horrible, it was very bad.
Remember, Marcus is not very intelligent, however!
He says, "I almost walked out."
"To walk out of something," usually a movie or a play or some performance, means to leave the theater before it has ended, usually because it is so bad ? it is not very good.
Marcus says, "The acting was wooden and uninspired, and the direction was amateur."
The "acting" is the way the actors talked and moved.
When we say acting is "wooden" (wooden), we mean it's without emotion.
Another word we may use is "stiff," when it's not showing enough expression.
When the actors are not showing enough emotion, that would be "wooden."
Marcus thought it was "wooden and uninspired."
"Uninspired" is the opposite of "inspired"; "uninspired" would mean dull , uninteresting , not exciting , not original .
He says the direction for the movie "was amateur."
The "direction" is the actions that the director of the movie takes.
The "director" is the person who tells the actors what to do and how to act, usually.
Something that is "amateur" is something that is not professional; here, it means not very good.
Sally says, "Aren't you being too critical?"
"Critical," here, means negative , always saying something bad about something.
"Critical" has a couple of different meanings in English; take a look at the Learning Guide for some more explanation.
Sally continues, "It was the director's first movie and I thought his directorial debut wasn't bad."
"Directorial" is just an adjective from the word "director," the person in charge of the movie, who's telling people what to do in the movie.
A "debut" (debut) is the first time that someone does something for the public ? the first time you do something in front of other people if it's a performance, for example.
So, this is the first time the director has directed a movie; Sally thought it was pretty good.
"If there was a problem," Sally says, "it was with the screenplay."
"Screenplay" (one word) is the script; it's the words that are written down and the instructions that the writer of the movie has put on paper, and that the director uses and the actors use to "produce" ? to make ? the movie.
Usually, the person who writes the screenplay is different than the person who is the director; sometimes it's the same person.
The joke here in Los Angeles is that everybody is writing a screenplay.
When you go to the local caf?s, you see people working on their laptop computers, and everyone seems to be writing a screenplay ? including me!
Sally says that the problem was with the screenplay.
Marcus says, "Don't get me started on the screenplay," meaning let's not talk about that because I have even more negative things to say.
When someone says "don't get me started on (something)," they mean let's not talk about it because I have bad things to say about it.
Marcus says, "The story was so predictable and the dialogue was pretentious."
Something that is "predictable" is something that you know is going to happen ? it's obvious, there aren't any surprises in the movie.
When we say something is "pretentious," we mean that it's trying to appear more important, or better, or bigger than it really is.
It's a negative adjective.
When you say someone is "pretentious," you are criticizing them; you are saying they're trying to be more important than they really are.
Marcus says, "This movie is going to bomb for sure."
The verb "to bomb," here, mean to fail ? to be a disaster.
In American English, we often use this to describe a movie or a play or a television show that is not successful ? that does not do very well.
Marcus says, "If you want to do your readers a favor (meaning if you want to do something good for your readers Sally), you would tell them to skip this movie and save their money!"
To "skip" something means to decide not to do something or see something.
"I'm going to skip the news tonight" ?
I'm not going to watch it.
Of course, if there were a movie called The McQuillan Story, it would probably be quite successful, so I think Marcus doesn't really know what he's talking about!
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
