Can I help you with something? 
Yes, I was hoping you could recommend a restaurant nearby. 
What kind of food would you like? 
I'm not picky. 
I'm looking for something moderately priced that's within walking distance. 
There's a good seafood restaurant called "Galeno's" about two blocks away. 
Would you like me to make a reservation for you? 
Thanks, but that won't be necessary. 
I need to check with my guest before deciding. 
By the way, I'll be in town for four days, and I'd like to see the sights. 
Is this your first time here? 
Yes, it is. 
Then, I'd suggest seeing our museums and the botanical gardens, and don't miss the shopping district near downtown. 
Can I get there on foot? 
I'm afraid not. 
You can take a taxi or a bus. 
We have a very good bus system. 
The other option is to take a tour. 
There are several tour companies that have day tours leaving from this hotel. 
Help yourself to their brochures. 
They're over there. 
Do you have a map showing where those sights are? 
Sure. 
Here you are. 
Is there anything else I can help you with? 
No, that's all. 
You've been a big help. 
Thanks.
