A friend from work, Nia, asked a few of us over to her apartment to watch the game this Sunday and I was really nervous. 
I've always liked Nia and I was hoping we could be more than friends. 
My brother, Charlie, said that if I really liked her, I should be sure to give her plenty of compliments when I saw her. 
I arrived on Sunday and knocked on her door. 
Hi, I'm glad you could make it. 
You're the first one here. 
Make yourself comfortable. 
Thanks and you look great. 
Red looks great on you. 
Oh, thanks. 
It's nice to be out of work clothes. 
Can I get you something to drink? 
Sure. 
What are you having? 
I'm just having a beer. 
Want one? 
Sure. 
What a cool place! 
This is a really nice apartment. 
Here you go. 
Actually, I just moved in last month and I'm still decorating. 
But, that's nice of you to say. 
Wow, nice picture. 
Did you paint this? 
No, I didn't. Someone named Picasso did. 
It's just a copy. 
You know, I really appreciate the compliments, but what's up? 
Up? 
Nothing. 
I'm just glad to be here. 
Well, I'm glad you're here, too. 
Now, drink up. 
The others should be here any minute. 
Sure. 
Cheers!
