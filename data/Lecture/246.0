I was away from my office and needed to send some letters to clients. 
Unfortunately, I didn't have their addresses, so I called the office secretary. 
Hi, Jacob. 
I need your help getting the mailing addresses for a couple of clients. 
Sure. 
Which ones? 
I need addresses for Jim Kelly and for Dr. Uemura. 
Okay. 
Jim Kelly's address is... 
I'm sorry Jacob, but my cell phone cut out and I didn't hear you. 
Could you repeat the street address? 
Sure. 
It's 1212 South Peabody Court, Lansing, Michigan, 48908. 
I didn't catch the end of the address. 
Did you say boulevard, avenue, or street? 
It's actually court, and the street number again is 1212. 
Thanks. 
I've got that. 
Could you also spell the street name? 
Sure. 
It's P-E-A-B-O-D-Y. 
You know what? 
I see a note here that he's in North Dakota until June. 
Let me give you that address. 
Mail should be sent to him in care of or to the attention of The Letty Institute, P.O. Box 345, Fargo, North Dakota, 58102. 
Got it. 
How about an address for Dr. Uemura? 
Here it is. 
It's 300 Goodman Building, University of Massachusetts, 234 Hitch Way, Amherst, Massachusetts. 
Do you have the zip plus four? 
It's 01003-9272. 
Oh, I just realized that I only have Dr. Uemura's last name. 
I want to include his first name, too, on the addressee line. 
Can you look that up for me? 
I've got it right here. 
His first name is Brent. 
Thanks a lot, Jacob. 
You've been a big help. 
Don't mention it.
