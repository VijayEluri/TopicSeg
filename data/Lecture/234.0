I've been getting a lot of headaches the past few weeks and my co-worker suggested I go see an optometrist. 
Okay, let's take a look. 
Do you wear glasses or contacts? 
I used to, but I had laser eye surgery three years ago and I don't wear them anymore. 
I see. 
Well, let's check your vision. 
It may be that even though your vision was 20/20 after the surgery, it's changed and you are now either nearsighted or far-sighted. 
Cover your left eye and take a look at the eye chart. 
Read the last line that you can make out. 
I can read the fourth line down ? X, C, D, O, M, A. 
Hmmm...okay. 
Cover your other eye and do the same. 
Good. 
I'm going to have you look through this machine and I want you to tell me if A or B is sharper and clearer. 
Okay, A or B, A or B? 
A is a little blurry. 
I think B is better. 
Okay, I think that you've developed some far-sightedness and will need reading glasses. 
I'm writing out a prescription for you. 
When you've picked out a frame, give them the prescription and they'll make your lenses. 
Any questions? 
So, do you really think I need reading glasses? 
I'm not that old. 
I'm sorry to say that you do. 
Some people have to get them earlier than others. 
At least you're not having any serious eye problems like glaucoma. 
Yeah, I guess that's one thing to be grateful for.
