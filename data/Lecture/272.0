I'm snowed under with work! 
I can't seem to keep up with everything I have to do. 
You're always so organized and efficient. 
How do you do it? 
I'm not always organized and efficient, but I've gotten better since I read a book about time management . 
I use a few tools that the book recommends, which help me to plan and to keep track of deadlines. 
Do you think it would help me? 
Definitely 
This is what I do. 
I keep a to-do list of all of the things I need to do. 
Then, I decide which tasks are high-priority and which have low-priority . 
I write down the deadline I'm given for the task or I assign a deadline of my own, and I make a note of the most urgent tasks. 
That seems pretty simple, but how do I keep track of the progress I make on a task? 
Sometimes things just slip through the cracks for me. 
I do a couple of things. 
First, I keep my list updated. 
I check off or cross off those that I've done. 
I also put reminders for myself on my computer to help me with scheduling. 
It helps me to remember my appointments and to allocate my time better. 
That sounds like a great system. 
All I need now is some extra time so I can start doing some time management!
