Our dialogue begins with Emiliano saying to Fatima, "I'm not sure about this video conference today."
A "conference" is a general word we use to mean a meeting between two or more people.
A "video conference" is when you have two or more people in a different place, sometimes in different countries, but they are able to talk to each other on the television or video screen.
Nowadays, we do this on the Internet.
Emiliano says that he's "not sure about this," he doesn't know quite what to do.
He says that "It's the next best thing to having a meeting face-to-face, but I've never used most of this equipment before."
The expression "the next best thing" to something means it is almost as good as; it's the second best choice or second best option ?"the next best thing."
To meet someone "face-to-face" means to meet someone in person; you are physically both in the same location.
You are in the same room; that's meeting someone "face-to-face."
The other expression we use there is "in person" (in)?
"in person."
Fatima says that using the video conferencing equipment is "a piece of cake."
The expression "a piece of cake" (cake), like the cake that you eat, means it's very easy; it's quick; it's simple.
Someone may say, "Downloading ESL Podcast is a piece of cake!
It's very easy to do."
Fatima asks Emiliano, "Do you want to do a run-through with me?"
To do a "run through" something means to practice something before you actually do it.
Or, if you are going to be doing a performance?you're a musician or a speaker, and you are going to be talking or performing in front of many people, you want to practice first; you're going to do a "run-through."
Emiliano says, "Do you mind," meaning yes, if it's okay, if you have time to help me.
"I'd really like to make sure that I know how to work this webcam and microphone."
Notice the use of the verb to "work" something; to "work" means to use something in this case, or to make something function properly or correctly? to make something work correctly.
Usually, we use this when we are talking about electronic gadgets, things like televisions, or iPods, or computers.
"Can you show me how to work this"?can you show me how this works; how do you use it correctly.
A "webcam" (webcam) is short for a web camera, and that is a small camera that takes your picture so that you can send the video over the Internet.
The web, of course, is the Internet.
A "microphone" (microphone) is, you probably know, a small, electronic thing that makes your voice louder.
I'm speaking into a microphone right now.
Notice the verb to "speak into" the microphone.
Fatima says, "I don't mind at all," meaning it is no problem; I would be happy to help you.
She then says, "we have Internet connectivity, so streaming won't be a problem."
To have "Internet connectivity" means that you have an Internet connection?you are able to get on the Internet.
"Streaming" (streaming) is a word we use on the Internet for when you are able to hear something or see something as it actually happens, that's one meaning of the word.
So, you may want to watch your favorite baseball team, and you go onto the Internet and you find someone that has a streaming video of the baseball game as it is being played live, that would be one way of using this word "streaming."
Fatima says that "The speakers on both computers are turned up."
"Speakers" (speakers) are things that make sound louder.
There's a couple of different meanings, however, of the word "speaker," take a look at the Learning Guide for more explanation.
To "turn something up," or to "turn up" something is another one of those two word verbs in English.
Here it means to increase the volume; to make something louder.
Usually, when you have a speaker on your television, or on a radio, or on your computer, you can "turn it up"?you can make it louder.
Emiliano asks Fatima if she knows "how to adjust the webcam?"
The verb to "adjust" (adjust) means to make a small change in something.
If you are watching the television and the picture doesn't seem very clear, you can "adjust" the antenna?you can change the antenna, make a small change so it works better.
Fatima says that it's easy to adjust the webcam.
She says, "Just use these buttons to zoom in or out, and you can tilt up and down."
To "zoom" (zoom) means to make something bigger.
For example, in a video camera, to zoom in, or to zoom, means to make one part of the picture bigger.
To "tilt" (tilt) means to change, or adjust, the angle of something.
You can usually tilt something up or down, left or right.
We often use this verb in talking about a camera?a video camera, so that you can move it in one direction or another.
That's to "tilt" it.
Emiliano asks Fatima, "Are you getting audio on your side?"
"Audio" (audio) is recorded sound that comes from a speaker or a machine.
Fatima says, "Yes, you're coming in loud and clear."
When we say, "you're coming in," we mean I am hearing you?I am receiving the information.
"You're coming in loud and clear," meaning very clearly; it's very easy to understand you.
Then Fatima says, "I think we're in business."
The expression, to "be in business," in this case, means to be ready to begin; to be ready to do something.
To be successful at something is to "be in business."
The expression "in business" can also mean that you have a company?a business that sells something, for example, but here it just means that you are ready to do something.
In this case, Emiliano is ready to be part of his video conference.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
