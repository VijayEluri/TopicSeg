Can you keep it down in there? 
I'm trying to write a song. 
You are? 
What kind of song? 
It's none of your business . 
Come on . 
Tell me. 
It's for Melanie. 
Oh, it's a love song. 
That's so romantic. 
Are you going to serenade her? 
Maybe. 
Now leave me alone so I can write. 
Don't kick me out. 
Maybe I can help. 
Let me hear what you have so far. 
Oh, all right. 
Here are the lyrics . 
There're pretty rough . 
Can you think of something that rhymes with flower? 
Hmm...let me see. 
They're not bad, not too sappy . 
Let's hear the melody ...That's nice. 
The chorus is catchy . 
Are you going to sing it a cappella ? 
I was going to ask Jimmy to play the guitar to accompany me, so I can make a recording of it. 
Let me do it. 
I can play the guitar. 
No way. 
You won't take it seriously. 
I will. 
I promise. 
I'll make little kissing noises in the background and it'll move her to tears . 
Forget it! 
What was I thinking telling you about it?!
