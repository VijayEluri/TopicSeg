One of the things I like to do on the weekends is go to garage sales. 
I'm a bargain hunter and collector, so garage sales are good places for me. 
I look in the newspapers or just follow homemade signs to find the sales in my neighborhood. 
Whether it's because people are doing spring cleaning or getting ready to move, there are always plenty of sales in my area. 
After going to a lot of garage sales, I've learned a few things about getting what I want at the price I want. 
Bargaining on price is par for the course at any garage sale. 
If you don't want to get ripped off , you'll try to get the sellers to lower their price. 
I'm an early bird and I usually get to the sales before other people to get the best items. 
But to get the best prices, be sure to go back right before the sale ends. 
Most people are desperate to sell so that they don't have to store those things again or to lug them to a charity office to give them away. 
That's when people are ready to slash their prices . 
It's true that there is a lot of junk and knickknacks at garage sales. 
But one person's trash is another person's treasure!
