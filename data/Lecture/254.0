Hey, where have you been? 
I was going to invite you to lunch, but you weren't at your desk. 
I was at a training. 
What was it on? 
Office hygiene. 
Hygiene? 
You're kidding. Your office is pretty messy but I wouldn't say you needed hygiene training. 
Very funny. 
Each department has to go through it. 
You'll have your turn next week. 
Apparently, the management wants to reduce the spread of illnesses around the office. 
They say that people are taking too many sick days and it's bad for productivity. 
So, we all have to sit through a training. 
What a pain! 
It's not like we don't know how to wash our hands. 
Yeah, I know. 
The trainer did a pretty good job, though, explaining how germs spread around the office. 
It's easy to infect other people when you have a cold or something else that's contagious. 
She said that viruses get around pretty easily. 
She gave us some pointers on how to preven it, though. 
Well, I use antibacterial soap all the time, so I don't worry about it. 
You know, the trainer said that those soaps may not be that effective. 
People think they're sterilizing their hands, but they may be doing more harm than good. 
Really? 
I've never heard that before. 
Then you'd better go to the training. 
I guess you need it more than I do. 
Yeah, very funny.
