It's your turn to put the kids to bed. 
No, I put them to bed last night, didn't I? 
Nope , I did that. 
Don't forget their bedtime story . 
The kids won't let me forget it. 
Okay, time for bed! 
Go brush your teeth and put on your pajamas . 
It's lights out in 15 minutes. 
What are you doing? 
I'm finishing my newspaper. 
Aren't you going to watch over them to make sure they're getting ready for bed? 
Nope. 
You have your methods and I have mine. 
Okay, this I've got to see . 
I don't hear anyone brushing their teeth. 
If everyone isn't in bed in five minutes, they're going to get a cuddle from Norman. 
Who's Norman? 
Norman is just a little scary monster I told them about. 
Norman eats little children who aren't in bed when they're supposed to be. 
It's my way of making sure they stay in bed through the night . 
That's terrible! 
That'll give them nightmares . 
Nonsense . 
It won't do them any harm . 
As my father told me, Norman only eats bad children.
