Okay, everybody. Listen up. 
We're approaching the end of the month. 
Unless you're new here, you know that we are in competition with our rival, the East Coast office, to have the most sales this period. 
At the beginning of the month, we pulled ahead and it looked like we were finally going to turn the tables and defeat the East Coast office. 
But after the first 10 days of this month, we fell into a tie with them, and as of last Friday, we are still neck and neck. 
We're now coming up to crunch time and the last thing we want is to fall behind when it looks like we may be able to top the East Coast office for the first time in two years. 
I'm really proud of this office for outdoing itself to get us in a position to win, and there's no reason we should suffer another loss now. 
Okay, everybody, let's put our noses to the grindstone and pull out this victory!
