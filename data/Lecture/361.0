Moving to a new city can be a lonely experience. 
When I first moved to Los Angeles, I didn't know anyone and it was hard to strike up new friendships. 
I'm a pretty sociable person, but it's still hard meeting new people and even harder to make lasting friendships. 
I've never been a lone wolf, so being in a new city out on my own was a new experience. 
Sometimes I liked doing solitary things, but after awhile, I yearned to be around other people. 
I would go to busy places to people-watch. 
I would see families walking by, groups of friends hanging out together, and couples arm-inarm, and wished I was walking along with them. 
When you're feeling lonely, it sometimes feels like there's a wall between you and everyone else, a wall that's not easy to break down. 
Slowly, I started to meet people at my new job and to see them outside of work. 
Having this companionship and camaraderie, especially with people I had a good rapport with, was a welcomed change. 
In time, I made some good friends and I no longer dreaded the weekends. 
But, I've never forgotten how hard it was in those first months to be a stranger in a new place!
