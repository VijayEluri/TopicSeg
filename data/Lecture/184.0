Good morning, everyone. 
I believe we are all here. 
Please be seated and let's get started. 
Please join me in welcoming Olivia Dansk, from Garland Corporation. 
I'm afraid that Lionel Wu from Manatect can't be with us today, but I'm pleased to welcome representatives from both Danforth and Boyent. 
We're here today to discuss the progress of our joint venture project. 
Have you all received a copy of the agenda ? 
Good. 
As you can see, there are six items on the agenda. 
If there are no objections , I suggest we take the items in order . 
Let's start with number 1. 
I think that takes care of the first item. 
Why don't we move on to item number two. 
I'd like to hand it over to Olivia, who will take us through the report. 
Olivia? 
If there are no other issues to discuss , I'd like to wrap up this meeting. 
Our next meeting will be on Monday, November 20th. 
Before we end today, I'd like to thank all of you for coming. 
This has been a very productive meeting.
