Whoa. 
Check you out. 
That's a great costume . 
Are you going to the Star Trek convention? 
Yeah. 
It's in town until Sunday. 
Have you ever been to one? 
Me? 
No way. 
Don't get me wrong. 
I'm a fan of the shows and, no offense , but I thought only geeks went to the conventions. 
Yeah, I thought that too until I went last year with my friend Claire and we had a great time. 
Claire? 
Your gorgeous roommate Claire? 
That Claire? 
Yeah. 
There were exhibitions from collectors and we got autographs from two of the show's stars . 
The highlight was when the stars came out and spoke to the crowd . 
Hey, do you want to come with us? 
It actually sounds like fun but I can't make it today. 
How come? 
Um¡¦well¡¦I'm going to the comic book convention. 
Oh, I see. 
Well, maybe next year. 
Live long and prosper. 
Uh, yeah. 
You, too. 
Hey, tell Claire I said "hi." 
Sure. 
See you later.
