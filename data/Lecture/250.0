What are you doing? 
I'm getting ready for the test. 
By writing the answers on a cheat sheet? 
You're not going to get away with that. 
I got a "D" on the last test and I have to do better on this one. 
If I don't get at least a "B," I'm going to flunk this class. 
You're taking a big risk. 
You could get suspended or expelled! 
I know, but my final grade is on the line. 
And plus, I think that the worst that could happen is that I get an automatic "F" on the test. 
It's not like I'm stealing a copy of the test or plagiarizing on an important assignment. 
Still, there's no telling what Mr. McQuillan will do to you if he finds out. 
I'd let you copy off my test if I thought we could get away with it, but he always keeps a close eye on us during tests. 
That's why I think you're going to get caught. 
It's not like I have any choice, do I? 
It's either cheating or going to summer school. 
I still think it's a bad idea. 
Then, just don't think about it. 
Let me worry about it, okay?
