I can't believe it. 
You're late again! 
I got caught up at work. 
What are you so worked up about? 
I've had it up to here with your excuses . 
If you knew you were going to be late, why didn't you call? 
We've been over this a hundred times. 
There wasn't time to call. 
And plus , what's the big deal? 
I'm just a little late. 
A little late? 
You are an hour late. 
You are so inconsiderate sometimes¡¦[sigh]¡¦ 
You look tired. 
Yeah, I am. 
Look , I'm late and I was inconsiderate. 
Let's not let it ruin our evening. 
Okay, I'm sorry. 
Maybe I overreacted. 
I know you've been really busy at work. 
I'm the one who's sorry. 
I should have called. 
Will you let me make it up to you? 
You don't have to. 
I shouldn't nag . 
You weren't nagging. 
Let's go get something to eat. 
We'll both feel better with some food in our stomachs. 
Yeah, you're right. 
Let's go.
