Why are we stopping here? 
We can't go to the dinner party empty-handed . 
We need to bring a bottle of wine . 
I don't know anything about wines. 
You'll need to pick a bottle. 
I don't know much about wines, either. 
I just know we need a good table wine . 
Do you think we should get a bottle of white , red , or ros? ? 
I don't know. 
The label on this one says that it's fruity and not too tart . 
This other one says that it's full-bodied , but I think we want a light-bodied one, right? 
I have no idea. 
The label on this one says that it's from a California vineyard . 
Is that good or bad? 
I don't know. 
Stop asking me. 
Here's a corkscrew . 
Why don't you take out the cork and we'll have a taste? 
That's very funny . 
You're not helping me at all. 
I say we just bring them a six-pack . 
I know I'd rather have beer than wine any day. 
Stop fooling around. 
We need to pick out a bottle of wine. 
I have an idea. 
Let's bring them a bottle of champagne . 
You can't go wrong with champagne. 
Champagne? 
It's not a special occasion. 
We'll tell them that being invited for dinner in their home is a special occasion for us. 
They'll be happy to hear that. 
I don't know about that. 
Trust me. 
Grab a bottle and let's go. 
We're late!
