I'm not sure about this video conference today. 
It's the next best thing to having a meeting face-to-face , but I've never used most of this equipment before. 
It's a piece of cake. 
Do you want to do a run-through with me? 
Do you mind? 
I'd really like to make sure that I know how to work this webcam and microphone . 
I don't mind at all. 
Okay, we have Internet connectivity , so streaming won't be a problem. 
The speakers on both computers are turned up. 
Do you know how to adjust this webcam? 
Right now, it's focused on my right ear! 
That's easy. 
Just use these buttons to zoom in or out, and you can tilt up or down. 
Oh, I see. 
That's better. 
Now you can see my entire face. 
Are you getting audio on your side? 
Yes, you're coming in loud and clear. 
I think we're in business . 
Well, that wasn't so hard. 
Let's hope it goes this smoothly this afternoon. 
If you have a problem, just give me a call. 
Thanks. 
I really appreciate it!
