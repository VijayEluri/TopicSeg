Our dialogue between Margo and Ali begins by Margo saying, "Oh geez, you're drenched!"
When you say, "Oh, geez," you mean "Oh, dear."
It's an expression usually that something bad has happened.
To say someone is "drenched" means that they are very, very wet.
You might also say they're "soaked" (soaked) .
To be "drenched" or to be "soaked" means to be very wet.
Margo says, "It wasn't supposed to rain today.
Ali says, "I know.
I looked at the weather report last night and it was supposed to be a nice day.
The "weather report" is sometimes called the "forecast," it's information about what will happen with the weather in the next couple of days.
Unfortunately, most forecasts are at least partially inaccurate in many places, especially places where the weather changes quickly.
Ali is angry; he says, "That's the last time I trust those weathercasters!"
When someone says, "that's the last time I...(something)," they mean that they're angry, that they will not listen to those people again.
The people here are the weathercasters; a "weathercaster" is a person who tells you what the weather will be like on the television or on the radio.
We used to call them the "weatherman," but now there are both men and women.
In some places, the weathercaster on television or on the radio is actually a real meteorologist.
A "meteorologist" is someone who has studied at the university about things related to the weather.
On some channels, like a couple here in Los Angeles, the weathercaster is just a beautiful woman.
I'm not sure which I prefer, you can guess!
Ali says, "I hate getting caught in the rain."
To "get caught in" something means that you are surprised by something; you weren't expecting something, often a bad thing.
"I got caught in a traffic jam" ?
I wasn't expecting it, and suddenly there were many cars, and I was moving very slowly.
Ali gets caught in a rainstorm; he says, "I'm soaking wet."
We already said "soaked" means very wet.
This is an expression you'll sometimes hear: "I'm soaking wet," means I'm very wet; I'm drenched.
The word "soaking" has a couple of different meanings; take you look at our Learning Guide for some additional definitions.
Margo says, "When I felt a raindrop on my head this morning, I should have known that we were in for a big rainstorm."
A "raindrop" (one word) is one drop ? or piece, if you will ? of rain.
It's a small ball of water that falls from the sky.
Margo says, "When I felt a raindrop on my head (or when I felt it hitting my head), I should have known (I should have understood and realized) that we were in for (that we will be expecting, or should be expecting) a big rainstorm."
A "rainstorm" is a storm with a lot of rain, when you get a lot of rain for a certain period of time.
Margo says, "Right then (meaning at that moment), I should have gone back into my house to get an umbrella, but as usual, I was running late."
An "umbrella" is what we call the thing that you use so that the rain does not fall on you.
It's usually round and is put above your head.
Margo says she was "running late," meaning she was late for her work; she was "behind schedule," we also say.
Ali says, "I can't believe I have to go out on sales calls today," meaning he has to go and travel to other buildings ? other businesses.
He's obviously a salesperson.
He says, "I'm not looking forward to getting back in my car when it's raining cats and dogs out there."
The expression to "rain cats and dogs" means to rain very heavily ? to rain a lot.
We might also say to "pour."
Someone will say "It's pouring out there," meaning it's raining very hard.
I'm not sure why we say "cats and dogs," but that's the expression: "to rain cats and dogs."
Margo says, "Somebody in this office must have an umbrella you can borrow.
I'll go see" ?
I'll investigate.
Ali says, "Thanks. It looks like it's only drizzling now."
To "drizzle" (drizzle) means to rain very lightly or only very slightly.
Another verb we use is to "sprinkle," when it isn't raining hard; it's the opposite of "raining cats and dogs," but it's still raining.
Ali says, "Maybe it's letting up."
To "let up" is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to gradually decrease, to slowly become less and less intense.
So, if you say, "the rain is letting up," you mean that it is getting less and less severe ? it's raining less and less.
Margo says, "Don't count on it."
The expression to "count on" something means to depend on something or to rely on something; to believe that something is true in this case, to believe that something will happen.
Margo says, "It'll be pouring again in a minute (it will be raining very hard again in a minute ? in a very short time).
Let me see if I can round up an umbrella and maybe even a raincoat."
To "round up" is another two-word phrasal verb meaning to find something or to get something.
You go look for something, and then you find it.
We usually use this expression when you're not sure where something is; it's not normally a big thing ?
"to round up" something.
That verb, "to round up," has a couple of different meanings in English; once again, take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations on that phrasal verb.
Margo says maybe she can even find a raincoat.
A "raincoat" is a rain jacket; it's something you wear over your regular clothing to keep you dry.
Ali says, "Thanks. I'll be in the bathroom wringing out my clothes."
To "wring (wring) out" something, or to "wring something out," is, once again, a two-word verb ? a phrasal verb.
It means to take a wet piece of clothing or a towel and turn your hands in opposite directions so that the clothes or the towel becomes tighter and tighter, and as you do this, as you are twisting the piece of clothing, water will come out of it.
It's a way of getting water out of something that is wet, out of a fabric.
At the end Ali says, "What a miserable day!"
Something that is "miserable" is very unhappy or very uncomfortable.
You can also use that word to mean "displeased," unhappy about something that someone has done.
"It's raining, and now I'm miserable."
"My wife left me, and now I'm miserable" ? or very happy, it depends, really, on who your wife is.
In my case, I would be miserable, of course!
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
