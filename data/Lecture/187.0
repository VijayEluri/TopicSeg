My favorite time of year is the summer. 
I like being outdoors, doing anything from hiking to going to the beach. 
One thing about working in an office all week is that I don't get much fresh air. 
With summer here, I plan to take full advantage. 
Last week, I went to the beach with some friends. 
I was glad I brought sunscreen since it was a really hot day, and I'm sure I would have gotten a sunburn within 15 minutes! 
We set up our beach umbrella and beach chairs, and played some volleyball. 
A few of us went into the ocean for a swim , but most of my friends just lounged around on the sand. 
This weekend, I'm going hiking. 
I stopped by the store and got some insect repellent. 
The last time I hiked in the mountains, I came back with big mosquito bites all over my legs. 
This time, I'm going to be prepared. 
I was going to try a new trail and I wasn't going to let a few mosquitoes get in the way.
