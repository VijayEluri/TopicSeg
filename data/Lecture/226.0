Now that the holidays are here, it's time to decorate the house. 
Every year, we always go all out . 
We buy a Christmas tree and the kids decorate it with ornaments that we've bought and made over the years, and with silver and gold tinsel . 
We also hang a wreath on our front door and I make sure that there's mistletoe above every door. 
Around the chimney , we hang our stockings, and when we get holiday cards from our friends and neighbors, we put them all around the room. 
Outside of the house, we have lawn ornaments that we put in the front yard. 
People who visit our house will see snowmen (and snowwomen), reindeer , and of course, Santa Claus. 
The best part is the outdoor lights. 
I string them across the front of the house, around our trees, and in our fence. 
When I turn them all on, you can probably see our house from miles away. 
It's no wonder that people come from all over town just to see our house at night. 
I have to say that I enjoy the holiday season as much as the kids...and maybe just a little more!
