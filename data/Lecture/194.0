About a month ago, my friend Richard called me and asked if he could come stay with me for a couple of weeks. 
I usually don't like having houseguests but Richard was a good friend. 
He's an artist and he was thinking about moving to LA. 
He wanted to see if he could get a job in the area. 
I told him, yes, of course, and he came down right away. 
As I said, that was a month ago. 
He's been living in my guestroom ever since. 
I like Richard and we get along, but I just don't like having a roommate. 
Sometimes he gets in the way when I want to invite someone over and he's always hogging the couch. 
One of my pet peeves is a dirty bathroom and Richard is a slob. 
I finally decided to let him know that he had overstayed his welcome. 
But, how do you throw out one of your best friends? 
On the day I was going to talk to Richard, he came home with some big news. 
He had met some guy at the employment agency and he planned to move in with him. 
I was bowled over! 
He had just met him. 
I tried to talk him out of it, but he'd made up his mind. 
Richard has always been a free spirit so who am I to tell him what to do? 
I just hope he'll be happy.
