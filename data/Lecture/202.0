It's been a long time since I've seen my friends Steve and Liz, and I thought this would be a good weekend to drive up to Santa Barbara to see them. 
Gas prices have been through the roof , but I decided to take the short road trip anyway. 
Before getting on the road, I went to the gas station to fill up my tank. 
I drove past the full-service pump and parked at the first self-service one. 
I got out of the car and saw that there was an "out of order" sign telling customers to pay inside . 
I wanted to pay at the pump so I got back into the car and pulled up to the next one. 
Luckily for me, this one was working. 
I swiped my credit card and took the gas cap off. 
I pushed the button for the grade of unleaded gas I wanted and put the nozzle into my tank. 
There was a sign on the pump that read, "Do not top off ." 
After the tank was full, I replaced the nozzle and pressed the button for a receipt . 
Right when I was about to leave, I noticed that my windows were dirty, so I got the squeegee and some paper towels and cleaned them. 
Now, I was ready for my drive up north.
