Our dialogue begins with Barry asking Jane, "Where are you going?"
Jane responds, "I'm checking up on Rudy."
To "check up on someone" means to review someone's progress; to see how someone is doing, usually someone who works for you or someone that you are supervising.
To "check up on" is a phrasal verb, and it is used here to talk about a boss who is supervising an employee.
Jane says, "I gave him (Rudy) a task an hour ago and I want to make sure he's doing it right" ? he's doing it correctly.
A "task" is a small project, usually something at your work.
Something that you need to do and finish ? a "task."
Barry says, "You're not micromanaging again, are you?"
To "micromanage" means to try to control all of the details of how someone does his or her work ? trying to make sure that you are controlling every little step.
This is often considered a bad idea, because your employee doesn't have a chance to develop their own skills, but some people, obviously, think this is necessary in some cases.
Jane says to Barry's question, "Of course not (I'm not micromanaging).
I'm only going to observe his work and to make sure that he's following the detailed instructions I gave him."
Jane is going to observe, or watch, his work.
She's not going to interfere, she's not going to change anything; she's just going to look and see what he is doing.
Barry says, "That sounds like micromanaging.
If you're always looking over their shoulders, how are you ever going to develop trust with your employees?"
The expression "to look over someone's shoulder" means to watch someone very closely while they are doing something.
So you could be literally ? actually ? standing behind the person and looking and seeing what they are doing.
My wife does this sometimes when I'm washing the dishes; she wants to make sure I'm doing it right, so she's always "looking over my shoulder."
Barry is saying if you're always checking up on your employees ? always observing them ?
"how are you ever going to develop trust with your employees?"
"Trust" is, in this case, a belief that someone else is good or reliable, a belief that someone else will do something correctly.
Jane says, "My employees will earn my trust by being meticulous with their work."
Notice we use the expression "to earn (earn) someone's trust."
To "earn" normally means to get money ? to make money, but here you're saying that you have to do something in order to deserve it ? in order to get that reward.
So, her "employees will earn" her "trust by being meticulous."
"Meticulous" (meticulous) means very careful, very detail oriented.
Paying attention to all of the details, that's "meticulous."
Jane says, "Good employees don't mind me monitoring their progress."
To "monitor" means to observe ? to watch over closely.
Barry says, "That may be true, but I've heard Rudy and Jena talking and they said they're feeling a little resentful that you don't have more faith in their ability."
Rudy and Jena are Jane's employees; they've been talking and they feel resentful.
To "feel resentful," or to "be resentful," means you're unhappy about something that isn't correct ? that isn't fair.
The noun is "resentment."
So, the employees are feeling resentful that Jane doesn't "have more faith in their ability."
To "have faith" in something means to trust in something ? to believe that something is real or possible.
Barry says Rudy and Jena "feel like you're treating them as though they're incompetent."
"Incompetent" means unable or incapable of doing something.
Someone who doesn't have the ability to do something, someone who hasn't learned how to do something but tries to do it anyway ? we would say they're "incompetent."
It's a very negative word to describe an employee, or anyone.
Jane says, "I am not," meaning I am not treating them as though they're incompetent.
"You're making me sound like a control freak."
A "control freak" (freak ? two words) is a person who wants to be in control of everything all the time, someone who always needs to be the boss ? the person who is taking care of and controlling a situation.
I am a control freak; my wife is a control freak ? this often causes problems since we both want to be in control.
That's a "control freak."
Barry says, "I just call them like I see them (I just tell the truth).
Micromanaging is a bad tactic and I can see why your employees are disgruntled."
A "tactic" is a way of doing something, similar to the word "strategy."
It's a "tactic" ? it's the way I do something.
Barry is saying that "Micromanaging is a bad tactic and I can see (I can understand) why your employees are disgruntled."
To be "disgruntled" means to be unhappy, to be disappointed, to be annoyed about something that has happened.
Jane says, "I resent that."
We had "resentful" before; "resent" is the verb.
"I resent that" ? this means I feel sad or disappointed by what you are saying.
Jane says, "I have a very good working relationship with my employees."
Barry says, "I'm sure you do.
I was just trying to help."
That's an expression we use when the other person is upset by something that you've told him or her ? some advice that you gave them that they didn't want.
"I was just trying to help.
I'm really not trying to butt in."
To "butt (butt) in" is another phrasal verb meaning to become involved in something that you shouldn't be a part of ? to try to be part of a situation where you don't have any right to be in.
Jane says to Barry, "Fine (meaning okay).
You manage your staff the way you think is best and I'll manage mine," meaning stop trying to interfere with me ? don't butt in.
Barry says, "Fine by me."
The expression "fine by me" means okay, it's all right.
It means I don't have any objection to what you are saying ?
"fine by me."
Sometimes we say that after we have a disagreement with someone, it expresses a little bit of anger, a little bit of disappointment ? at least it does in this dialogue
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
