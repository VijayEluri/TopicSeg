Oh geez , you're drenched ! 
It wasn't supposed to rain today. 
I know. 
I looked at the weather report last night and it was supposed to be a nice day. 
That's the last time I trust those weathercasters ! 
I hate getting caught in the rain. 
I'm soaking wet. 
When I felt a raindrop on my head this morning, I should have known that we were in for a big rainstorm . 
Right then, I should have gone back into my house to get an umbrella , but as usual, I was running late . 
I can't believe I have to go out on sales calls today. 
I'm not looking forward to getting back in my car when it's raining cats and dogs out there. 
Somebody in this office must have an umbrella you can borrow for the day. 
I'll go see. 
Thanks. 
It looks like it's only drizzling now. 
Maybe it's letting up . 
Don't count on it. 
It'll be pouring again in a minute. 
Let me see if I can round up an umbrella and maybe even a raincoat . 
Thanks. 
I'll be in the bathroom wringing out my clothes. 
What a miserable day!
