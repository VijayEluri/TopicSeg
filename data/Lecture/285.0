Some people collect stamps. 
Other people collect CDs. 
I collect movies. 
I'm a film buff and I have a collection of my favorite movies of all time. 
I usually buy a movie when it comes out on DVD, even if I've seen it already on the big screen. 
I have a high definition TV and I like watching movies in the comfort of my own home. 
I prefer the widescreen editions and the DVDs with a lot of bonus features. 
I pride myself on finding every Easter egg on every DVD I own. 
My friends think I'm crazy. 
Even if I already own a movie, I'll buy it again if there's a special edition or box set with extra bloopers or deleted scenes. 
Even when I'm on vacation, I look for DVDs. 
Last year, I was traveling abroad and I bought some DVDs. 
When I got home, though, I found out that I couldn't play them in my DVD player because they had a different region code than the one we use in the U.S. 
I also bought a bootleg DVD on the street and the quality was terrible. 
I really learned my lesson on that trip!
