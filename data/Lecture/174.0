Thanks a lot for agreeing to help me plan the block party . 
Oh, I'm happy to help. 
I'm surprised you didn't ask Bree. 
She's so good at planning parties. 
I thought about it, but I was afraid she would turn it into a cocktail party or something. 
Yeah, I see what you mean. 
Well, I made a guest list to see how many people may be attending. 
We can put the invitations in their mailboxes this weekend. 
It will be a potluck, so I'm asking people to RSVP and to let me know what they plan to bring. 
What kind of things do we need? 
Well, I'm asking people to bring a main dish , chips and dip , or dessert. 
It won't be a BYOB like last year, so Lynette and Edie are bringing some soda. 
I can supply the paper plates and cups, and the plastic utensils . 
That's great. 
It sounds like you have everything under control. 
I really can't believe it. 
There's a first time for everything.
