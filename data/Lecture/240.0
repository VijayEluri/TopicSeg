Hello. 
Hi, it's me. 
I can't make it home for dinner tonight. 
I'm working overtime. 
Again? 
That's the third time this week. 
I can't believe your boss is making you do this. 
Don't get mad, but I actually told him that I didn't mind. 
I know I've been working long hours, but I don't want to turn down the work. 
You know that I'm getting paid time and a half, and we need the money. 
I know we do, but we're getting by. 
What happened to a 40-hour workweek? 
You've been working at least 60. 
It's not worth it for you to work your fingers to the bone no matter how strapped we are. 
I know. 
I know. 
It's just that morale around this place is pretty low and I'm just trying to do my part. 
Just don't gripe. 
Okay? 
I'm not griping. 
I'm just worried about you. 
You come home after a long day, and you're overworked and emotionally drained. 
That's not fair to the kids. 
You're right, but could we talk about it this weekend? 
I've really got to go. 
I promise we'll work it all out then. 
Okay, but what time are you coming home tonight? 
I'm not sure, but I'll try to make it home in time to tuck the kids in. 
All right. 
I'll see you then. 
Bye.
