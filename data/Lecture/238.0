What I wouldn't give to get away for a little vacation! 
Me, too, but we can't afford it. 
Oh, I don't know. 
It's off-season in a lot of popular places right now, so it may be doable. 
Maybe. 
We'd have to find some pretty deep discounts. 
There is a big advantage to traveling during the low season, though. 
It's a lot less crowded. 
Yeah, I like that. 
I'll see if I can find a package deal that includes airfare and lodgings. 
That may give us the best deal. 
We have one thing going for us. 
We have flexible travel dates, which should make it easier to take advantage of any special promotions. 
That's true. 
I'm start looking online and I'll let you know what I find. 
I know what a good bargain hunter you are, so if anyone can find a good deal, it's you. 
I'm not at all sure I can find something we can afford, but it won't be for a lack of trying. 
I really need that vacation!
