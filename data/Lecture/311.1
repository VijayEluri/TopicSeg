This episode is called "A Mid-life Crisis."
"Mid-life" is the middle of your life; "mid" is short for "middle" here, so "mid-life" would be between perhaps 40 and 50, maybe 60 years old.
A "crisis" is an emergency situation.
So, a "mid-life crisis" is some sort of change ? some emergency situation that takes place in your mid-life period.
However, the term is usually referring to a period in a man's life when he becomes unhappy because he's getting older and he realizes he's getting older.
So, he sometimes does strange things to try to feel younger, like buy a new car.
Or, start a podcast!
In the dialogue, Bella says to Russell, "I think my husband is going through a mid-life crisis."
Russell says, "What makes you think that?" ? why do you think that?
Bella said, "He just traded in his car for a very expensive sports car."
To "trade in" means to exchange one thing for another thing.
This is especially common in the U.S. with your car.
You have a car that's maybe 5-10 years old and you want to buy a new one.
You bring it to the people who sell cars ? we would call them a "dealership" ? and you give them your old car and they give you a certain amount of money for the old car as a discount off of your new car.
Well, Bella's husband traded in his car for an expensive sports car.
A "sports car" is usually a smaller car with a very powerful engine that moves very fast.
That would be a "sports car."
In addition, Bella says that her husband is "filling the house with gym equipment."
"Gym equipment" are machines you can use for exercise such as a treadmill or weights.
Some men, when they go through their mid-life crisis, will try to become more healthy ? become more fit, get a younger car, if you will.
Russell says, "Oh, that's a bad sign."
A "sign" is something that indicates what might happen in the future; it's a signal, an indication.
Russell says, "Do you know what may have triggered this?"
To "trigger" (trigger) means to start something, to begin something, to make something happen.
It's often a small event that starts a much larger sequence of events.
For example, many wars are triggered by small misunderstandings.
Two countries may fight each other over what seems like a small thing; that small thing is the trigger.
Russell says, "Do you know what may have triggered this?"
Bella says.
"I'm not sure, but he was passed over for a promotion at work a couple of months ago."
To be "passed over" for something means not to receive something that you expected, especially at your work.
You expected to get a better job, what we might call a "promotion," and you didn't get it; they gave it to someone else.
In this case, they gave it to someone who's 15 years younger than Bella's husband.
Russell says, "That would do it," meaning that would be sufficient ? that would be enough to start this mid-life crisis.
Bella continues, "What really worries me is that he's been talking about quitting his job altogether (meaning completely, entirely ?
"altogether") and becoming a full-time writer.
He always wanted to be a successful writer," she says.
Russell says, "That's sounds familiar (that's something I am familiar with).
When my brother went through a mid-life crisis, he spent a lot of time reflecting on his life."
To "reflect on your life" is to think about ? to think seriously and for a long time about something.
To "reflect" has other meanings as well; take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Russell's brother "spent a lot of time reflecting on his life, and regretting giving up music to get a full-time job."
To "regret" (regret) means to feel sad that you didn't do something in the past, or that you did do something: "I regret not saying ¡®I'm sorry' to my friend last week," or "I regret going to Phoenix, Arizona in the middle of the summertime" ? because it's a 120 degrees Fahrenheit there!
That's "regret."
Russell says that his brother "saw himself (viewed himself) as being washed up," and that "he was fed up with everything."
Here are a couple of two-word, or phrasal, verbs with the word "up" in them.
To be "washed up" means to be no longer useful or no longer successful.
To be "fed up" means to be tired or frustrated, unhappy, perhaps even bored with a situation.
If you are waiting in line for one hour in order to talk to the manager of a store, you might get "fed up," you might get frustrated.
Bella says, to Russell, what did your brother do in his mid-life crisis?
Russell does not want to tell Bella.
He says, "Well, he's probably not a good example of what your husband would do" ? he did something different than what your husband would probably do.
Bella then uses a common idiom, "Don't beat around the bush" (bush).
To "beat around the bush" means to be indirect, to hesitate, not to say something directly but try to, we might also say, "talk around it" rather than directly about it: "Don't beat around the bush."
Russell says, "Well, if you must know," meaning if you insist, if you really want me to tell you, even though you might not like it I will tell you.
Russell says his brother "got a divorce," which is the legal of a marriage, when a man and a woman are legally no longer husband and wife.
He "married a woman half his age," that's something that men in their mid-life crises sometimes do, I hear, and he "tried to start a rock band."
Bella says, "Oh, no!
That's just what I was afraid of."
Russell says, "I'm sure that won't happen with your husband," meaning your husband will be different.
"You two have a great marriage."
Bella says, "I thought so, too, but you never know."
"You never know" is a phrase that means anything is possible, anything can happen.
You never know, I might decide to take up football and become a football player here in the U.S. ? you never know!
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
