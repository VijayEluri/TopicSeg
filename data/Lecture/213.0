I went to the bike shop on Saturday morning to buy a bicycle. 
What kind of bike are you looking for? 
I'm really not sure. 
Well, let me show you what we have. 
We carry road bikes, mountain bikes, beach cruisers, and racing bikes. 
I'm going to start biking to work. 
I'll be riding mainly on the road, but I want something versatile enough for anything. 
Well, the road bikes are for everyday use. 
They have heavy frames and tires. 
The seats are comfortable and so are the handlebars. 
The mountain bikes are very sturdy for off-road cycling and have wider tires. 
Beach cruisers have just one speed, so you won't be shifting any gears. 
Okay. 
Are the brakes hard to handle? 
No. 
You either have foot brakes, like on the beach cruisers, or you have hand brakes. 
They're very easy to get used to. 
If you want to keep it simple, I would either go for a road bike or a mountain bike. 
Those are the most popular. 
If I get a bike, what other things do I need? 
I usually recommend an air pump, a bike lock, and a helmet. 
Okay, I'll take a look around. 
Sure. 
Just let me know if you have other questions.
