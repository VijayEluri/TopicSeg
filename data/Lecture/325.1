Brett begins the dialogue by saying to Molly, "Do you know what kind of mood Mom is in?" ? do you know the way that Mom is feeling right now, what is her attitude ? is she happy, is she sad, etc.?
Molly says, "Not really.
Why?"
Brett says, "I really need a raise in my allowance."
A "raise" is an increase.
An "allowance" is a small amount of money that some parents give to their children each week or every two weeks that they can spend on whatever they want.
Brett wants to increase his allowance; he wants his parents to give him more money.
Brett says that his mother will "be more likely to say ¡®yes' if she's not feeling too grouchy."
"Grouchy" (grouchy) means not happy, someone who's always complaining.
"I am always grouchy in the morning when I have to get up early" ?
I am not happy.
Not normally, but sometimes I'm grouchy!
Molly says, "I wouldn't count on this being a good time."
To "count on" is a twoword phrasal verb meaning to rely on, to depend on, to assume that something will be a certain way.
There's a common expression "don't count on it," meaning don't rely upon it ? don't depend upon it, it may not happen.
Molly says that her mother "looked a little upset after getting off the phone with Aunt Teri."
To "get upset" means to get angry or worried or anxious.
It's the opposite of "calm."
So, she looked a little upset after she hung up the phone ? after she stopped talking on the phone with Aunt Teri; she got off the phone.
Brett says, "Why?"
Molly says, "Aunt Teri has been down in the dumps."
To be "down in the dumps" (dumps) means to be very sad, to be unhappy, to be depressed.
That's to be "down in the dumps."
Why is Aunt Teri down in the dumps?
Well, because her son Frank, who is Brett and Molly's cousin, "decided to take a job in Cambodia," a country in Southeast Asia, very far away.
Molly says Frank is "on cloud nine about this new job."
The expression to be "on cloud nine" means to be very happy, to be overjoyed, to be extremely happy: "I'm on cloud nine."
It's not exactly clear where the expression "on cloud nine" comes from.
Some people say it comes from an old way that scientists used to measure the height of clouds, and "cloud nine" was the highest level.
Other people say it comes from Buddhism, in describing being very close to your final goal or destination.
I'm not sure which, if either, of these explanations is correct, but everyone understands it to mean very happy.
If I won the lottery today, I'd be on cloud nine ? maybe cloud 99!
Molly says that her Aunt Teri is "anxious" about Frank moving away so far.
To be "anxious" means to be worried, to be nervous.
Brett says, "I see (I understand).
Well, I've got to think of some way to cheer her up."
To "cheer someone up," or to "cheer up someone," means to make someone feel better, to make someone feel happier ? to do something that will make them feel happier.
Brett says, "It's a lost cause if I ask her while she's angry, on edge, or depressed."
To say something is a "lost cause" means it is impossible, it can't be done.
My singing teacher tells me, "Jeff, you're a lost cause.
There's nothing that can be done to improve your singing."
I'm a lost cause!
Brett uses some adjectives to describe his mother's possible moods.
He says she could be "angry," meaning mad, when you don't like something very much.
She could be "on edge," meaning she's nervous or excited about something.
The expression "on edge" has a couple of different meanings; take a look at the Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Or, Brett says, his mother could be "depressed," meaning very unhappy.
Molly says, "You know that Mom is always happy to hear good news about school.
Do you have anything new to report?" meaning do you have anything new to tell her.
Brett says, "I hadn't thought of that (I hadn't thought of that idea).
I need to come up with something."
To "come up with something" means to think of something ? a new idea.
Molly says, "Be patient," in other words, don't rush, don't be in a hurry; be able to wait, be patient.
"Wait for the right moment and then strike."
To "strike" usually means to attack someone, to do something without warning the other person.
Molly, here, is using it somewhat in a humorous sense, telling Brett to wait until the right moment and then ask his mother.
Molly says, "I speak from years of experience," meaning I have many years of dealing with and talking with our mother, I know how things work with her.
Brett says, "Right. Thanks."
Now let's listen to the dialogue again, this time at a normal speed.
