Our story begins by me saying, "Moving to a new city can be a lonely experience."
We've already explained "lonely" as feeling alone, by yourself.
When I first moved to Los Angeles ? and this is a true story ?
I didn't know anyone and it was hard to strike up new friendships.
"To strike up something" means to begin something.
"To strike up a conversation" means to start talking to another person, to begin a conversation.
"To strike up a new friendship" means to begin a new friendship, to become friends with someone.
When you don't know anyone, it's hard to strike up new friendships.
I say that I'm a pretty sociable person.
Someone who is "sociable" is very friendly, likes spending time with other people; very "outgoing," we might say.
But it's still hard meeting new people and even harder to make lasting friendships.
Something that is "lasting" is something that goes on for a long time, endures for a long time.
A "friendship" is, of course, when you are friends with another person.
So, a "lasting friendship" is when you are friends with someone for very long time.
I say that I've never been a lone wolf.
The expression "lone wolf" (two words) is a person who likes to be alone more than to be with other people.
A "wolf" is actually an animal, but the expression "lone wolf" refers to someone who likes to be by themselves.
Well, I am not to a lone wolf, so being in a new city out on my own was a new experience.
When we say you are "out on your own," we mean that you are independent; you are no longer being supported by other people.
Many college students live with their parents, or their parents pay for their education and their housing, and then they go out on their own.
They find a job and they live in their own apartment, and so forth.
I was actually out on my own back in Minnesota before I moved to Los Angeles, but I was also on my own here in LA when I first moved here back in 1991.
I say that sometimes I like to do solitary things.
"Solitary" (solitary) means alone, isolated, without other people.
There's a card game called "Solitary," that you can play by yourself, because it requires only one person.
If you are in prison ? in jail ? and you do something wrong or they think you're a very dangerous prisoner, they will sometimes put you into "solitary confinement," which means you are in a place all by yourself, with no other prisoners.
"After awhile," I continue, "I yearned to be around other people."
"To yearn" (yearn) means to desire or to want something very much.
We might also use the expression "to long for."
"To long for" is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to really desire something, to really want something.
I would go to busy places to people-watch.
"People-watching" means just what it says, you go to a public place, a mall or someplace where there are a lot of people walking by, and you look at them, how they act, how they're dressed, perhaps what they are talking about.
That's "to people-watch."
Here in Los Angeles, most people drive cars from one place to another.
Even if it doesn't take very long to walk they'll still drive, so there are not a lot of places you can go to people-watch, where people are actually walking down the street.
It's very different from many big cities such as New York, where everyone walks, especially in downtown, or in Manhattan.
But here in Los Angeles, there are not that many places where people actually walk around.
I say that I would see families walking by, groups of friends hanging out together, and couples arm-in-arm.
"To hang out" is an informal two-word phrasal verb meaning to spend time with someone in a very relaxed way, not to have any specific plans.
So, I saw groups of friends hanging out together, and couples arm-in-arm.
"Arm-in-arm" means walking with your arms linked, or connected.
The other person is holding onto your arm.
I would see couples, men and women, walking arm-in-arm.
I wished that I was walking along with them.
You can also say, here, "I wished I were walking along with them."
In formal English grammar, "were" is considered correct.
However in daily conversation, it is very common and completely acceptable to say "was" in this case.
When you're feeling lonely, it sometimes feels like there is a wall between you and everyone else, a wall that's not easy to break down.
"To break down" is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to get rid of something, to eliminate something.
"To break down" has a couple of different meanings; once again, take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
"Slowly," I say, "I started to meet people at my new job and to see them (to go out with them) outside of work.
Having this companionship and camaraderie was a welcomed change."
"Companionship," here, means basically the same as friendship, being with someone that you like, not being alone.
"Camaraderie" means the feeling of friendship among a group of people who spend time together.
"Camaraderie" is when you get along well with the people around you; they are your good friends.
So, I say that having companionship and camaraderie, especially with people I had a good rapport with, was a "welcomed" change ? a good change.
"Rapport" (rapport), notice the "t" is not pronounced, means a good understanding, friendliness between and among people.
When you have easy communication with someone, you have good "rapport" with them.
In time ? meaning over time, after a while ?
I made some good friends and I no longer dreaded the weekends.
"To dread" (dread) means to fear something that is going to happen in the future, to be worried about something that might happen.
I used to dread the weekends probably because you are used to being with friends and family on your weekend days and nights, and so if you are alone, you feel even more lonely because you don't have anyone to spend your time with.
And that was certainly true for me the first year or two that I lived in Los Angeles; I used to dread the weekends.
Well, I no longer dread the weekends.
