Our dialogue is called "Cable and Satellite TV."
There are three common ways of getting television in your home; the easiest is what we call "broadcast," or "over the air" TV.
These are usually channels three, four, five, maybe more, that you can buy a television set for; put up an antenna and you can get that those channels.
If you want more channels ? more variety ? you can get either cable TV or satellite TV.
"Cable television" is when the company puts a wire into your house.
So, it's a long wire that connects to your television.
"Satellite TV" is when the company puts a small what we would call a "dish" on the roof, on the top of your house.
A "satellite dish" is a piece of equipment that is pointed to a "satellite," which is a machine that is up very high in the earth's atmosphere that goes around the earth.
You get the television channels from the satellite dish.
In our dialogue, Marion says to Cesar, "I'm trying to decide whether to get cable or satellite TV.
Which one do you have at your apartment?"
Cesar says, "I have satellite, but I used to have cable."
Marion asks, "What's the difference?"
Cesar says, "Not a lot (not very much, they're very similar).
With satellite, you have to have a satellite dish installed on the roof and you don't with cable."
Cesar is saying that if you have satellite TV, they have to "install," or put, the dish on your roof, on the top of your building.
To "install" means to put a piece of equipment or some sort of service into place so that it works.
We also use that word for software: "I'm going to install some software on my computer" ?
I'm going to put it on my computer so that it works.
Cesar says that "You can get basic channels and choose from a lot of different premium channels."
"Basic channels" are the channels, or stations, that are included in the lower cost type of cable or satellite TV.
"Premium channels" are ones that cost more money.
For example, there is a popular movie cable channel called "HBO" (Home Box Office).
That is something you have to pay extra for.
Here in Los Angeles, cable television, for the basic service, is probably about $40-$50 a month; satellite television is about the same, maybe $40-$50- $60 a month.
If you want premium channels ? movie channels ? you have to pay another $10 a month, usually.
Cesar says that he has "a package that includes the basic channels and some premium movie channels."
He also has a sports package so he can watch all of the soccer matches he wants.
A "package" here means a group of things that are sold together.
So you can get maybe two or three movie channels, and they give you a discount if you order all three of them as a package.
The word "package" has a couple of different meanings in English;
take a look at our Learning Guide for some additional explanations.
Marion asks Cesar, "How much is the monthly fee?" ? how much money do you have to pay every month ? the monthly fee.
"Fee" (fee) is the cost ? the price.
Cesar says, "I think I pay $59.99 a month (59 dollars and 99 cents), excluding the taxes and fees."
To "exclude" means not to include; it's the opposite of include ? not to count.
So, "excluding taxes" means $59.99 does not include the taxes and fees.
Cesar says, "When I had cable, I had to pay a deposit for the cable box."
When you have cable television, or satellite television, they usually give you a little electronic box that you put on top of your television and the cable goes into the back of the box.
For cable TV, sometimes you have to pay the local company a deposit.
A "deposit" is money that you give them; you get your money back when you bring them the box back.
So, it makes sure that you are going to return the box.
If you don't return the box, then you are going to lose your deposit.
He says with satellite he owns his dish outright ? he owns the equipment outright (one word).
"Outright" means completely, totally, in full.
He owns the equipment, he doesn't have to pay a deposit or rent it.
Marion says, "What I want are pay-per-view channels."
"Pay-per-view channels" is a service that allows you to get just one movie or one sports game: "I just want to watch one movie."
You can buy that movie to watch it on your television.
It usually costs $2, $3, maybe $4.
That's "pay-per-view," you pay for each one that you want.
Cesar says, "That's not a problem.
There's video on demand on both cable and satellite."
"Video on demand" is a program that you can watch any time you want to; you don't have to wait until a certain time for the program to begin.
We call that "video on demand."
Podcasting is audio on demand; whenever you want it, whenever you ask for it, you can listen to it.
Marion says, "That's great.
I'll check out whether my local cable company or satellite service has better packages and make a decision this weekend."
Cesar says, "You could always start with the basic channels and then add services as you go along."
The expression "as you go along" means over time, as you continue with something.
Marion says, "That's a good idea, especially since I know someone who has premium channels and round-the-clock soccer."
"Round-the-clock" means all the time ? 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Marion is, of course, referring to Cesar, who has the soccer package ? the sports package.
Cesar says, "You bet," meaning "yes, no problem."
"Drop by anytime, but don't forget the beer and popcorn!"
Cesar is saying "you can visit me any time."
To "drop by" means to visit someone who is not expecting you.
You don't have an appointment with that person, you just go to their house or office, knock on their door, and visit them.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a native speed.
