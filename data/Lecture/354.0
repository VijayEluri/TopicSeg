I'm not going into that house. 
It's supposed to be haunted. 
Come on. Don't be a coward. 
You don't believe in ghosts, do you? 
I don't, but I'm not taking any chances. 
Just look at that house! 
It's spooky. 
I'm getting goosebumps just looking at it. 
You're only freaking out because you've watched too many horror movies. 
It's just a house. 
Now, come on! 
Why are we doing this anyway? 
Just because your friends dared you to go in doesn't mean you have to. 
This is stupid! 
I took the dare and I told them I'd spend the night in that house. 
If you're a scaredy-cat, you can go home right now. 
And let you go in there by yourself? 
What kind of girlfriend would I be? 
I'm scared to death, but I'm not going to chicken out. 
Okay, let's go before I change my mind. 
Really? I didn't think you'd have the nerve. 
You're braver than I thought. 
Don't worry. Nothing in there can hurt us. 
Famous last words!
