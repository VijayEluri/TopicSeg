I'm trying to decide whether to get cable or satellite TV. 
Which one do you have at your apartment? 
I have satellite, but I used to have cable. 
What's the difference? 
Not a lot. 
With satellite, you have to have a satellite dish installed on the roof and you don't with cable. 
Otherwise, you get similar options. 
You can get basic channels and choose from a lot of different premium channels. 
I have a package that includes the basic channels and some premium movie channels, and I also have a sports package so I can watch all of the soccer matches I want. 
How much is the monthly fee? 
I think I pay $59.99 a month, excluding the taxes and fees, but the basic service is probably cheaper. 
When I had cable, I had to pay a deposit for the cable box, but with satellite, I had to buy the dish outright, but it wasn't too expensive. 
What I want are pay-per-view channels, so I don't need to run to the video rental store every time I want to watch a movie. 
That's not a problem. 
There's video on demand on both cable and satellite, and there are a lot of movies to choose from. 
That's great. 
I'll check out whether my local cable company or satellite service has better packages and make a decision this weekend. 
You could always start with the basic channels and then add services as you go along. 
That's a good idea, especially since I know someone who has premium channels and round-the-clock soccer. 
You bet. 
Drop by anytime, but don't forget the beer and popcorn!
