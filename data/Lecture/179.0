I needed a new cell phone, and my friend recommended the company he used. 
I went into the store to take a look. 
Hi, have you been helped? 
No, I haven't. 
I'm looking for a new phone. 
Are you with our company right now? 
No, I'm thinking about switching . 
Okay, let me show you our most popular phone. 
This one has a lot of good features . 
It's got a camera phone , a video recorder , instant messaging , and you can download music or ring tones . 
I'm really looking for a flip phone . 
Oh, in that case, this is the one you want. 
Let me tell you a little about our plans . 
With our $59.99 plan, you get 400 minutes, unlimited night and weekend minutes, and free mobile-to-mobile . 
Do the minutes roll over if I don't use them all in one month, and do I need to sign an agreement ? 
We don't have rollover minutes, but if you think 400 isn't enough, we have higher plans for 700, 1000, and unlimited minutes. 
The $59.99 plan requires a one-year agreement. 
Okay, let me think about it. 
No problem. 
Just let me know if you have other questions.
