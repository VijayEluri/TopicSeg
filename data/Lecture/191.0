I was at the airport to pick up my friend Sandra, who was visiting from Italy. 
Do you have everything? 
Yes, I think so. 
But, I don't have any U.S. dollars. 
Where can I change money? 
Can I do that here? 
You could, but I wouldn't recommend it. 
The exchange rate is really high and so are the fees . 
I'll take you to the bank tomorrow. 
The next day, I picked Sandra up from her hotel and we went to a branch nearby. 
What can I do for you? 
I'd like to exchange some currency and to get some U.S. dollars. 
Okay, how much would you like? 
How much is one euro worth? 
The current rate is one dollar to .8 euros. 
In that case, I'd like 500 U.S. dollars. 
Okay. 
That will be 400 euros. 
Would you like that in large or small bills? 
I'd like a mix of both. 
I'd like some change , too. 
That's no problem. 
Please sign here. 
That will be 300 dollars in 20's, 150 dollars in 10's, and 45 dollars in fives and ones. 
And, here's five dollars in change: quarters, dimes, and nickels. 
That's perfect. 
Thanks a lot. 
Is there anything else I can help you with? 
No, that's all. 
Thanks for your help. 
It's my pleasure. 
Have a nice day.
