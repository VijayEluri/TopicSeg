Can I help you find something? 
Yes, I'm looking for some dress shoes for work, something with a low heel . 
Have you tried this brand ? 
They make really comfortable shoes. 
This company makes several styles of dress shoes, including a sandal , a low boot , and a loafer . 
These right here are open toe and those over there have a strap in the back. 
Oh, I like these slip-ons , but they seem too narrow. 
My feet are pretty wide. 
Those actually come in three widths : narrow, medium, and wide. 
Do you want to try them on? 
Sure. 
Do you have them in a 6-and-a-half or a 7, in black or brown? 
I'm not sure. 
I'll have to check in the back¡¦ 
Here you are. 
How does the 6-and-a-half fit ? 
They're a little too tight in the toe. 
Let me try the 7. 
Oh, that's better, but now the heel is a little too loose . 
Keep in mind that since they're leather , they'll stretch a little. 
In that case, I'll take the black pair in the 6-and-a-half. 
Great. 
I can ring you up over here.
