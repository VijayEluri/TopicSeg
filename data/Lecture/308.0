I've just switched over to this program and I can't figure out how to format my document. 
Can you help me? 
I can try. 
Let's take a look. 
What do you want to do? 
I want to change the margins so I can fit more on a page. 
I don't know how to change the default settings. 
I also want to put this section on a separate page. 
Okay, you can adjust the margins by moving this up and down, and from side to side. 
If you want this section on a separate page, just add a page break. 
Oh, I see. 
What if I want to add a header or a footer? 
You go to this pull-down menu and select the header and footer option. 
Then, you can type in the text you want. 
If you want to add a page number, just insert one by selecting it from this menu. 
That seems easy. 
What if I want to change the font? 
You can change the font style or size by selecting the text and then making the change on the toolbar. See? 
Yeah, that seems simple enough. 
I also want to change the orientation of the page. 
How do I do that? 
Right now your document is portrait. 
To make it landscape, you just go to the "Page Setup" and change it. 
That all seems pretty easy. 
I think I've got it. 
Good. Give it a try. 
If you get stuck, I can try to help. 
Okay, great! Now, can you go over again how to change the margins, insert a page number, change the page orientation, and add a footer?
