Our dialogue begins with Romeo saying to Juliette, "What do you plan to do?" ? what are you going to do?
Juliette says, "I don't know!
I can't defy my parents" ?
I cannot disobey my parents.
"To defy" (defy) means not to do what you have been asked to do, not to do what you are expected or supposed to do ? to disobey.
Juliette says, "I can't defy my parents.
They've been against our relationship from the start, and I've been forbidden to see you."
If you are "forbidden" to do something, you are prohibited from doing something ? you are not allowed or not permitted to do something.
So, Juliette says she's been forbidden to see Romeo ? how sad!
Romeo says, "It's your life, not theirs," just like a teenager might say: "It's your life, not theirs."
"It's time you stood up to them."
"To stand up to someone" means to confront someone or to say what you think ? what you really think to someone who disagrees with you.
It can also mean to fight for your beliefs: "stand up for yourself" ? stand up for what you believe, in other words, defend what you believe.
"To stand up to someone" means to defend your beliefs with that person.
Romeo says, "It's time (Juliette) you stood up to them (to your parents) and told them what you want.
I'm tired of being a puppet in the feud between your family and mine."
Romeo says, "I'm tired of being a puppet" (puppet).
A "puppet" can be a little doll that children play with, where you put your hand inside.
For example, the Muppets ?
Kermit the Frog ? those are examples of puppets.
But here, a "puppet" means someone who is controlled by someone else, who is like a puppet.
You say, "He isn't the real leader of his country, he's just a puppet," you mean the real leader is someone else, and he is just saying that he's the leader.
In this case, Romeo is saying, "I'm tired of being a puppet" ?
I'm tired of (being) someone who is controlled by someone else.
He's tired of being a puppet in the feud between Juliette's family and his.
A "feud" (feud) is a long fight or argument between two people or two groups of people that may have lasted for many years.
A long-standing fight is sometimes called a "feud."
Juliette says, "That's easy to say, but I can't confront my father and tell him that I want to be with you.
It would kill him!"
Juliette says she can't confront her father.
"To confront someone" is to speak to someone to tell them that you don't agree with them, or to talk with someone about your plans to do something, knowing that that person doesn't agree with you.
"I'm going to confront my boss tomorrow, and tell her that I need a bigger salary if I'm going to stay here" ?
I'm going to confront her, I know she'll say no and she'll disagree with me, but I'm going to confront her anyway.
And then, the day after tomorrow, I will look for a new job after my boss fires me!
Romeo responds to Juliette by saying your father is "using guilt to get you to give me up.
Don't let him manipulate you that way."
"Guilt" is when you feel sad or embarrassed because you think you did something wrong ? or you did something wrong; that's "guilt."
Your father is "using guilt (making you think that you've done something wrong) to get you (in order to get you) to give me up."
"To give someone up," in this case, means to end a relationship with someone, often in order to make somebody else happy, such as your parents.
There's a couple different meanings of this phrasal verb, "to give someone up"; take a look at our Learning Guide for some more explanations.
Romeo says don't let your father "manipulate you."
"To manipulate someone" is to use this person in a dishonest way; to do something to control the way someone else acts, without them knowing it or realizing it.
Governments sometimes manipulate public opinion and the media in order to get what it wants.
Juliette said, "This is tearing me apart" ? this situation is tearing me apart.
"To tear someone apart" is another two-word phrasal verb meaning to hurt someone emotionally, to put someone in a difficult situation where you can't decide what to do.
"This is tearing me apart" ? it's hurting me a great deal.
"I can't take it much longer," Juliette says.
Romeo then says, "You don't have to.
I'm leaving ? without you."
Juliette, not happy, says, "No!
You can't.
I can't live without you" ? just like the old song: (Jeff sings) "I can't live if living is without you."
If this were a musical, Romeo would sing!
Then, Romeo says, "Someday, we'll be together," and then he says, "Cut!"
"Cut" (cut) is a command that they use when they're making a movie or a TV show to get the actors to stop performing.
In other words, Romeo and Juliette are actors, and this is some sort of movie or TV show.
Romeo says "cut," meaning let's stop our acting right now.
He says, "Where is the director?"
The "director" is the person on a TV or movie filming that tells everyone what to do ? tells the actors what to do.
Romeo says, "This is supposed to be the story about star-crossed lovers, not a trashy melodrama."
When we say "star-crossed," we are actually using a phrase from a Shakespearean play, Romeo and Juliet, to refer to a romantic couple whose relationship cannot work ? cannot succeed.
People used to believe ? some people still do ? that the stars and the planets determined our actions on earth ? had an influence; we call this "astrology."
Well, this is the idea that somehow the stars are arranged so that we cannot have this romantic relationship.
Romeo says, "This is not supposed to be a trashy melodrama."
A "melodrama" is a story, a play, a movie, a book, where the characters seem to overreact to everything.
They're too emotional; you can't believe them, they don't seem realistic because they're too emotional.
If you watch a soap opera, for example, this is very melodramatic sometimes; the actors are what we would say "overacting," they're trying to be too emotional.
"Trashy" (trashy) means very poor quality, very low quality, not having any value.
"Trash" is what you throw away, things that you don't need.
So "trashy" means it's without much artistic value.
Then Romeo says, "Whoever wrote this trash should be fired!"
Maybe it would be better if they did the original Romeo and Juliet!
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
