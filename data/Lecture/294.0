I'm so exasperated ! 
I'm really tired of the homeowner's association in my condo building. 
What's the matter with it? 
The people who sit on the condo association board are a bunch of donothings . 
I've filed complaint after complaint and they refuse to enforce the house rules. 
Well, that might not be so bad. 
I used to live in a co-op in New York City. 
The board of directors in my building was constantly issuing violations to the shareholders and we were fined for the smallest infraction . 
It was a nightmare. 
What kinds of complaints have you been filing? 
I've been complaining about my noisy neighbors. 
They have parties every weekend. 
The board said it sent letters to them, but nothing has changed. 
That's a tough one. 
It's often hard to get people to quiet down. 
That's not all. 
The common areas aren't well maintained , and they're often dirty or in need of repair. 
That's too bad... 
And, the clubhouse is always busy with board events when I want to reserve it. 
That's frustrating... 
You bet it is. 
And, what's more... 
Whoa. 
I think I have a solution for you. 
What? 
Move!
