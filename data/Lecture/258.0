My girlfriend and I have been going out for a year and I thought it was time to have a heart-to-heart with her. 
I have something I want to talk to you about. 
Can you come over here and sit down for a minute? 
Uh oh. 
Is something wrong? 
No, nothing's wrong. 
In fact, everything's right. 
We've been together for a year and I've been happier than I've ever been. 
Me, too. 
Things are going great. 
What is this all about? 
I want us to move things to the next level . 
I want us to move in together. 
Simon, I love you, but we can't do that. 
You know how conservative my parents are. 
They would never approve . 
They like me, don't they? 
It's not a matter of whether they like you or not. 
They both adore you as much as I do. 
But two people moving in together before they're married goes against their beliefs and mine. 
But don't you want to? 
I'm very happy with you, but I want things to go on as they are. 
We spend so much time together anyway, we're almost joined at the hip . 
Are you saying you want more space ? 
No! 
What I'm saying is that I don't want to rock the boat when things are going so well. 
Why don't we hold off on any more talk about moving in together. 
I suppose that's okay - for now.
