Thanks for agreeing to meet with me about the new contract. 
It's important that both parties understand and agree to all of the terms before we can move ahead. 
It's in the best interest of both of our companies for this agreement to be signed, so I'm glad to be here. 
How should we proceed? 
You and I have both read the contract, but I think it's useful to go over the main articles to make sure there aren't any clauses that are objectionable. 
If you'll take a look at Article One... 
This looks in order. 
The stipulations we asked for are all there. 
Now if we can move to Article Six, I have a question about the conditions for declaring the contract null and void. 
I'm glad you brought that up. 
I know that this was a sticking point during the negotiations and I believe we've found an acceptable compromise. 
I'm sure you have. 
Let's take a look.
