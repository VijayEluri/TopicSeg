I t's been almost three months since I got a haircut and I went to the barbershop where I always get it cut. 
But when I got there, the barbershop had been replaced by a hair salon. 
Hi, I used to get my hair cut at the barbershop that was here. 
Yeah, they closed. 
We've been open for about a month. 
I can cut your hair. 
Uh...I guess that's okay. 
Why don't you come over here and sit down. 
What do you have in mind? 
Well, as you can see, my hair is pretty curly. 
When it's long, it looks like an Afro. 
I want it to be a lot shorter, but I don't want a buzz cut. 
Are you sure you want to cut it? 
If you keep it long, you could have great dreadlocks. 
Uh, I'm not sure that that style would work for me. 
Okay, then. 
How about if I cut it short on the sides, leave the bangs medium length, and then keep the back long? 
No, I don't think that would work, either. 
I'd like it an inch off the collar in back, above the ears, no sideburns, with a part down the right side. 
I really just need a trim. 
Hmm¡¦how about if I shave your head? 
You'd look great bald. 
No! 
I definitely don't want that. 
You know what, I just remembered that I'm supposed to be somewhere else right now. 
Oh, are you sure? 
I'm sure I know exactly what you want. 
I'm sure you do, but I really have to go. 
I left that hair salon as quickly as I could. 
Who knows what would have happened if I'd stayed there? 
She may have given me a Mohawk!
