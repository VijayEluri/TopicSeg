Finding a new place to live isn't always easy. 
I've been living in the same apartment for nine years, and I thought it was time for a change . 
I've always wanted to buy a condo or a townhouse , but I didn't have the money for a down payment . 
But now, I have a little money saved up, and I want to buy a place of my own. 
I didn't want to go through a real estate agent yet, so I started looking around the city on my own. 
I wasn't sure if I wanted a townhouse or a single-family home . 
I didn't want to live in a multi-story building anymore, not even if I had a penthouse unit . 
It was too noisy, and I wanted a backyard for my dog, Shiloh. 
I looked at a duplex as well as some traditional houses. 
One of the last houses I saw was a two-bedroom, one-bath bungalow . 
It was small enough for one person, but big enough for me and my dog. 
When Shiloh saw the backyard, I think it was love at first sight . 
I'd like to say that I picked the house, but really it was Shiloh's choice. 
I don't think he would ever forgive me if I didn't buy that house.
