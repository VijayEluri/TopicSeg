I left my hotel early so I would arrive at the convention center in time for my presentation, but the bad traffic made me late. 
My presentation was supposed to start at 2:00 and it was already 1:55! 
To make matters worse , I had never been to this convention center before and I didn't know my way around . 
I walked into the foyer and looked around. 
I was hoping to see a registration booth or the speakers' room , where I was sure someone could point me in the right direction . 
I walked down one hallway and found the main ballroom , but it was empty. 
I saw a sign for meeting rooms upstairs and went up the escalator . 
But when I got to the second floor, I didn't see anyone around. 
I looked over the landing , hoping to get my bearings , but that was no help. 
By this time, I was sweating bullets . 
The clock was ticking and I was late! 
Then, I woke up. 
It wasn't the first time I had a nightmare like this, and I knew it wouldn't be the last. 
I wonder what my subconscious is trying to tell me? 
At least this time, I was wearing my pants!
