I was at the store , and when the clerk finished ringing me up , I had a few problems. 
Your total comes to $79.42. 
Do you take credit cards ? 
Yes, we take Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. 
Here's my Visa. 
Hmm¡¦I'm sorry but your card has been declined . 
Oh, I can't imagine why . 
I'm sure it's just a mistake. 
Here, use my MasterCard. 
Well, sir, it looks like this one is overdrawn , too. 
Do you have a debit card or cash? 
We also accept personal checks . 
Like I said, I think it must be bank error . 
Yeah, I have a debit card, but I think there's a fee for using it, right? 
Yes, I think the bank charges you a small fee. 
In that case, I'll write a check. 
Oh no, I forgot my checkbook at home. 
Can you hold these items for me? 
I can run to an ATM to get some cash. 
I'll come right back. 
Sure. 
I can hold it for you until the end of the day . 
Okay, great. 
I'll be right back.
