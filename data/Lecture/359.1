Isabella begins our dialogue by asking Tony, "What are you doing?!
Why are you trying to hit that guy?"
"What are you doing" is usually something you say when you're angry at someone, you want to know why they are behaving the way they are.
Tony says, "He deserves it."
"To deserve something" means that you have done something good that would give you a reward, or you've done something bad that will give you a punishment.
For example, many people who try to lose weight think that they deserve to eat fatty food if they exercise every day.
They think they have earned the right; they have done something that will allow them to do something else.
Tony says this guy deserved being hit.
"He insulted you," he says, "I'm going to knock his block off!"
"To insult someone" means say or do something that another person things is rude or mean.
"To knock your block off," or "to knock his block off," means to hit someone so that, literally, his or her head falls off.
However, that's really not what it means; it means to physically hurt someone, to hit them in the face.
There was a popular children's game back in the 70s and 80s.
It was a toy that had two boxers, and you would hit these buttons to try to get the other boxer to have his head spring up from his body.
That was "to knock his block off."
Perhaps that's one of the origins of the expression, or at least why it's popular among some people ? old people, like me!
Isabella says, "Stop it!
Be civilized."
"To be civilized" means to be polite, to be kind, to be rational.
"This isn't some free-for-all," she says.
A "free-for-all" is a fight without any rules, where people can do whatever they want to do when they are fighting the other person.
Isabella says, "You can't punch a guy just because he said something offensive."
To "punch" (punch) means to hit someone with your fist ? to hit someone hard with your hand.
This is something you cannot do, Isabella said, just because this man "said something offensive."
"Offensive" means, here, insulting, rude, something to make another person angry.
Tony says, "Oh, yes I can (meaning yes I can punch him).
Let me at him (let me get to him)!
I'm going to clobber him."
"To clobber" (clobber) means to hit someone many times.
You sometimes see this verb used when talking about sports teams playing each other.
For example, if the Dodgers were playing the Yankees and they beat the Yankees in baseball 10 to 1, we would say that the Dodgers clobbered the Yankees 10 to 1.
Of course, I like the Dodgers as a baseball team, so that's what I want to happen!
Isabella says, "If you take another swing at him, he's going to have you arrested for assault."
"To take a swing at someone" is similar to punching someone.
You actually move your arm back and you try to hit them.
"To take another swing at someone" would be to try to hit them again.
Isabella says this man will "have you arrested (the police will come and take you) for assault" (assault).
"Assault" is when you physically attack or hit someone else.
At least that's the general meaning of the term; you could also hear someone using that verb to talk about an attack on, for example, civil rights: "This is an assault on our civil rights" ? they are doing something to hurt our civil rights, legally.
Isabella says to Tony, "Get a hold of yourself."
"To get a hold of yourself" means to bring yourself under your own control, usually by calming down and controlling your actions and emotions.
"Get a hold of yourself," you're wild, you're not thinking correctly, you're emotional.
Tony says, "I'm just trying to defend my sister's honor."
"To defend someone's honor" means to say or do something to protect their reputation, especially if someone has insulted or offended them.
Isabella says that violence is not the answer.
Then she suggests to Tony, "Let's get out of here (let's leave) and cool off a little."
"To cool off" is a two-word phrasal verb meaning to calm down, to allow someone to get control of their emotions.
There are a couple of different meanings of this term, as well as the term "to punch" that we mentioned earlier on.
Tony agrees to leave and says, "if I ever see that guy again, he'll get what's coming to him."
"To get what's coming to you" means to get what you deserve; usually it's a bad thing, to experience the consequences of your earlier actions or words.
So you do something wrong today, and tomorrow you are punished ? you got what was coming to you.
You did something wrong, and now you had something bad happen to you.
Isabella says, "Okay, okay, let's go."
Then she asks Tony what did the guy say.
Tony says, "He said you had nice legs (attractive, pretty legs).
The nerve of that guy!"
Tony says.
"Nerve," here, means a lack of respect, disrespect, a willingness to do something that is inappropriate or improper.
"The nerve of that guy" is a common expression.
"The nerve of that woman over there!" meaning she's doing something that she should not be doing that shows a lack of respect.
Isabella says, "That's it?" meaning that's the only thing he said, that I had nice legs.
Tony says yes, "Isn't that enough?" meaning that's sufficient for me to hit him.
Isabella says that Tony is "being overprotective."
"To be overprotective" means to take care of someone too much.
If a mother is overprotective of her children, the children may not learn the things they need to about how to survive in the world.
Any time you hear the word "over" in front of another word ? or usually it is what we would call a "prefix," it is actually part of the word ? you should realize that this word means doing something too much.
For example: "I overspent" ?
I spent too much money; "I overate" ?
I ate too much food; "I overexercised" ?
I exercised too much.
Well, not exercise for me, it's mostly eating!
Tony then says, "I'm your big brother and I'm making sure that no one messes with you."
"To mess with someone" means to create problems or trouble for somebody else.
You may say to someone, "Don't mess with me," means don't cause me any trouble, don't get me involved in trouble.
There's an expression in Texas, "Don't mess with Texas," meaning don't cause any problems for people in Texas.
I guess people in Texas are afraid of the rest of us ?
I'm not sure!
The State of Texas has a reputation for independence, for doing its own thing, for being different than other states.
Now let's listen to the dialogue, this time at a normal speed.
