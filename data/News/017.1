One year ago, the first cases of H1N1 flu appeared in Florida. At first, health officials were not sure what to expect.
"It was really a trifecta of viruses we hadn't seen," said Ryan Pedigo, the director of public health preparedness at the Hillsborough County Health Department.
Within months, the virus grew into a pandemic, affecting 60 million people in the United States alone.
The Centers for Disease Control estimates the virus has killed more than 600 people in Florida and more than 12,000 nationwide.
While we haven't heard as many news reports about the virus in recent months, health officials say it's still in the Bay area.
"Right now, we're experiencing lower levels than we would normally expect to see with the seasonal virus.  The primary we're getting now is still H1N1, but we're at such a low level of individuals reporting it, that it's considered very mild," explained Pedigo.
As the number of cases of H1N1 dropped, so did the request for the vaccine against the virus.
"Right after Thanksgiving, our demand dropped by 80 percent and we're not really sure exactly why, but people didn't want it after that," said Pedigo.
As a result, thousands of doses of the vaccine in Hillsborough County have already expired or on the verge of expiration.
"It could be 50,000 to 100,000 vaccines," said Pedigo.
It's no different in other Bay area counties.  The Pinellas County Health Department estimates it has 22,000 doses expiring by next month.  Polk County's Health Department says it has about 13,600 doses that have expired or about to.  In Pasco County, the health department there says 3,000 doses will expire on Friday.
Nationwide, the CDC tells 10 Connects some 60-70 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine have either expired or will expire within the next few months.
"My preference would have been for every citizen in Hillsborough County to raise their hand and say 'I want the vaccine.' That didn't happen," Pedigo told 10 Connects.
County health departments across the area are encouraging people who have not been vaccinated against H1N1, to get the shot.
"We'll work with anybody," said Pedigo.
The CDC says the United States spent $1.6 billion on the vaccination program.
While several million doses are potentially at risk of disposal, most health officials agree it was necessary to ensure there were enough doses on hand for anyone who wanted one.
"We did have a nova virus, it's a very dangerous virus," reminded Pedigo.
The CDC could not give an estimate on how much money will be lost by the expiration of doses never used, because so many are still usable and ready for anyone who wants one.
