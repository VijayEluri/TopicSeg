A free health clinic opened its doors today to thousands of patients clamoring for dental, vision and medical care.
The Los Angeles Sports Arena has been transformed into a health clinic that will run through May 3, with its floor lined with more than 100 dentist chairs and 40 medical examination areas to treat patients.
Patients registered in advance to see doctors at the event, which is being run by the Tennessee-based nonprofit group Remote Area Medical. The clinic expects to serve about 1,200 patients a day.
Many patients come to get specific ailments cared for, but all are given full medical examinations by doctors to screen for illnesses and problems.
"People come in because they have a toothache and they know they have a toothache, but they may not know they have hypertension or they're developing diabetes," said event producer Don Manelli. "We're about doing the good medicine. The idea is this is a free medical clinic but we're not compromising quality of care."
To help patients get follow-up care they may need, Manelli said the clinic has organized a volunteer phone bank to make appointments with a network of 130 community health clinics.
It's estimated that 6 to 8 percent of patients will need follow-up care, Manelli said.
Remote Area Medical held an eight-day clinic at The Forum in Inglewood in August that drew more than 6,000 patients, but thousands more had to be turned away.
In recent years, the group has expanded its focus from rural areas in the Third World to address growing needs domestically, with 60 percent of its clinics within the United States, Manelli said.
