The sequel to one of the most popular RTS games of all time has finally been slated with a release date, triggering countdown clocks at PC gamer homes across the country.
Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty is set to invade PCs on July 27. More than 11 million copies of the original Starcraft game have been sold since it was first released in 1998, and it retains an active user community even still today, 11 years later.
"We've been looking forward to revisiting the StarCraft universe for many years, and we're excited that the time for that is almost here," said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Starcraft's publishing studio Blizzard Entertainment.
Starcraft has proven to be not only a success in the US but also all over the world. In fact, Starcraft II's release will also come on the same date to Canada, Europe, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Mexico, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.
Starcraft II will introduce new unit types, provide a sizable slate of new maps, and offer a completely revamped online multiplayer service. The retail boxed version of the game hits stores on July 27, with a direct download version available "shortly after," according to Blizzard.
