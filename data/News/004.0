Apple Inc. continues to feed its hunger for chip companies.
People familiar with the situation say the Silicon Valley giant recently purchased Intrinsity Inc., a closely held company whose chip technology has been used to boost the performance of cellphones and other products. Some analysts believe that Intrinsity's technology is used in the A4, the Apple-designed chip used in the new iPad
These people didn't disclose terms of the deal. But Tom Halfhill, senior editor at the newsletter Microprocessor Report, on Monday reported a purchase price of $121 million.
That's about half of the $278 million that Apple paid in 2008 for P.A. Semi, a purchase that formed the springboard for Apple to build a chip design team to help differentiate its products.
The Web site EDN.com in early April reported the possibility of Apple buying Intrinsity, which was the subject of a New York Times article Tuesday. The Austin, Texas, start-up, is known for licensing technology that improves the performance of microprocessor designs from ARM Holdings PLC.
Last July, Samsung Electronics Co. - which manufactured the A4 and prior ARM-based chips for Apple-announced a deal to offer Intrinsity technology called Hummingbird. That technology allows a popular ARM microprocessor design to operate at 1 gigahertz, the same speed as the A4, noted Will Strauss, an analyst at the market-research firm Forward Concepts.
"The guts of the A4 processor appear to have been developed by Intrinsity and Samsung last year," said Jim Morrison, technical product manager of Ottawa-based consulting firm Chipworks.
