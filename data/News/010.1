For the first time, scientists have discovered evidence of water ice, as well as organic compounds, on an asteroid - findings that bolster a leading theory for the origins of life on Earth.
"Up until now there was no sign that asteroids had any abundant organics or ice on them," said Joshua Emery, a planetary astronomer at the University of Tennessee and an author of one of two studies on the discoveries. The new evidence supports the possibility that the essential building blocks for life came from asteroids.
The research, reported by two scientific teams working independently, appeared online Wednesday in the journal Nature. Both teams' conclusions are based upon analyses of infrared light reflected by 24 Themis, one of the largest asteroids in the solar system.
Because different materials absorb light at different wavelengths, scientists were able to establish the content of the asteroid by analyzing the light reflected by it. The asteroid contains both water and organic compounds, or molecules containing carbon, the teams concluded. With water, such molecules are the building blocks for producing and sustaining living things.
Both teams chose to examine the 120-mile-wide 24 Themis because it is one of the largest, brightest asteroids in the system, and thus one of the easiest to analyze. The researchers are unsure in what amounts or proportions the water and organic molecules exist.
The possibility that water could have come from asteroids adds weight to the theory that water and organic molecules - the bricks and mortar for creating life - may not have originated on Earth.
