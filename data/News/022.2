About 52 percent of social-network users post their full birth date, home addresses, vacation plans or other personal information that could increase their risk of becoming victims of identity theft or other computer crimes, according to a survey released today by Consumer Reports magazine.
The survey of 2,000 online households in January found that 38 percent posted the month, date and year of their birth, 8 percent posted their home address, and 3 percent posted details about when they were away from home. Also, 21 percent posted photos of their children and 13 percent posted their children's names.
The magazine, which said Americans have lost $4.5 billion to computer-related crime in the past two years, found that 9 percent of social network users experienced malware infections, scams, identity theft, harassment or other forms of online abuse.
The magazine suggested "seven things to stop doing on Facebook," the most popular social network:
-- Using a weak password. The magazine instead recommends using at least eight characters, with a mix of upper and lowercase letters, with numbers or symbols in the middle of the password.
-- Listing full birth dates, which identity thieves can use to access more information, credit cards or bank accounts. Show only a month and day, or don't show any birthday information.
-- Overlooking Facebook privacy controls, which "can limit access for almost everything that is posted on a profile, from photos to family information. Consider leaving out contact info, such as phone number and address."
-- Posting a child's name in a caption. "If someone else does, delete it by clicking 'remove tag.' If a child isn't on Facebook and someone includes his or her name in a caption, ask that person to remove the name."
-- Mentioning being away from home, which "is like putting a 'no one's home' sign on the door. Be vague about the dates of any vacations."
-- Being found by a search engine. In the "search" section of Facebook's privacy controls, select "only friends" and make sure "public search" box is unchecked.
-- Permitting youngsters to use Facebook unsupervised. For accounts of young children or teenagers, adults should become one of their friends and use their own e-mail for the account "to receive notification and monitor activity."
