Windows and 7 have now become synonymous with, well, new Windows that are not old Windows hence, less likely to annoy, irritate, or crash on you. The number 7 is super cool, y'all.
At the Embedded Systems Conference (ESC) Silicon Valley today, Microsoft announced the release of Windows Embedded Standard 7. 
Kevin Dallas, GM of the Windows Embedded Business Unit at Microsoft, told attendees that this new embedded OS will include Media Center as well as multigesture touch interfaces and context-aware applications with Windows Touch, and the ability to develop ``green'' solutions with smart power management APIs. Dallas went on to outline ways in which the new addition to the embedded OS market could help OEMs create richer, funner experiences for their audience. That should translate, or could translate, into big bucks.
Strategy Analytics estimates the potential market for Microsoft among the connected STBs, digital video recorders, digital media adapters and flat-panel TVs of this world is set to experience annual growth of more than 50 percent through 2014, expanding from 40 million units to more than 360 million.
Microsoft has long harbored a deep desire to get OEMs to jump on board its platform and is promising to deliver technologies that will allow vendors to create new revenue streams. This may come as a shock to those of you who get a cable bill every month where you get charged money for your STB, which is apparently a must with digital services anyhow, and even the odd remote. I mean, what other revenue streams are there: the digital clock going to cost extra because it dances to the tune of your wedding album? Eh?
TG Daily editors suck at paying for things.
