Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) is using two tablet computers to show off some of its new software, an effort that comes as erstwhile ally Apple Inc. (AAPL) claims a key Adobe product isn't suitable for mobile computing.
At a San Francisco conference on Wednesday, Adobe displayed two tablet computers--a device currently shipping from Dell Inc. (DELL) and a reference model from Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)--both of which run its new AIR 2 product. AIR 2, due out later this year, is software that lets website applications run outside of a browser.
The Dell tablet ran on Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Windows 7 operating system, while the Nvidia tablet used Google Inc.'s (GOOG) Android operating system.
"AIR works across desktops and devices," said Matt Rozen, an Adobe spokesman. "We are trying to show AIR 2 running on two different operating systems. This is just an early demo to get people excited."
The demonstration comes as San Jose-based Adobe weathers criticism from Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who has claimed Adobe's Flash video player isn't suitable for mobile devices. Apple has banned Flash from its products, including its popular iPhone and new iPad, and Jobs has said Flash is the No. 1 reason Macintosh computers crash.
"The mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards--all areas where Flash falls short," Jobs wrote in a widely cited blog posting last month. An Apple spokeswoman reiterated Jobs's comments that Apple uses open and standard technology.
The demonstration might help Adobe blunt criticism of its technology. While neither of the devices it displayed directly ran the Flash player, AIR 2 contains Flash as one of its core elements.
Zedomax, a technology blog, had earlier reported on Adobe's demonstration of the tablet running Android. That set off speculation the device may have been a Google tablet. A Google spokesman said the Internet search company wasn't involved in developing the demonstration tablet.
An Nvidia spokesman said the reference-model tablet uses its Tegra processor.
On Wednesday, Adobe shares closed down 0.5% at $32.96.
