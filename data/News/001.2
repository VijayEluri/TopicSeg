Two separate studies suggest chimpanzees deal emotionally with the death of loved ones in a similar way to humans. 
Scientists in Scotland filmed a group of chimps as an elderly female from their group died. Video from the study, posted on the BBC News website, shows the chimps grooming and caressing her body before she dies. The entire group remained passive for days afterwards. 
A second study, led by scientists at Oxford University, found similar circumstances. Researchers saw female chimps carrying around the bodies of their dead offspring, one for up to 10 weeks. Both studies are reported in the journal Current Biology. 
"But science has provided strong evidence that the boundaries between us and other species are nowhere near to being as clearly defined as many people used to think," James Anderson from Stirling University told the BBC. 
Chimpanzees and humans share about 99% of their DNA but the scientists say the findings suggest apes are even more like humans than we might think.
