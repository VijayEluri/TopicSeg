Los Angeles isn't exactly backwoods. Don't tell that to Stan Brock, founder of Tennessee nonprofit Remote Area Medical, or the roughly 700 volunteers donating their time and talents to thousands of needy Southern California residents this week. RAM L.A. opened its doors Tuesday at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, where organizers hope to serve free medical, dental and vision care to over 8,000 uninsured or under-insured patients during the next seven days.
Christi Thornton, unemployed and looking for work, was one of 1,200 to walk through those doors on Tuesday. ``It means everything,'' the Inglewood resident told the Los Angeles Times of the clinic. ``An opportunity to get glasses, dental work - that's important when you're trying to get a job.''
Remote Area Medical, founded by Brock in 1985 after he spent over a decade with the Wapishana Indians of the Amazon, is funded by donation and has hosted clinics in the most inaccessible regions of the world. Today, the nonprofit does the bulk of its work in America. Clinics will be hosted in Maryland in June, Oklahoma City in July, and Chicago in August, amongst other scheduled US dates.
But the Los Angeles clinic is the biggest and most logistically complicated. Last year, the event treated more than 6,300 patients at the Forum and, this year, organizers pledge to treat even more. It won't be easy. There's a shortage of medical volunteers and a surplus of patients. In 2009, thousands walked away from from RAM L.A. without receiving the care they sought. According to the RAM website, this year, one day into the week-long effort, the clinic is still looking for California certified ophthalmologists, optometrists, opticians, dentists and dental hygienists.
``I certainly hope that we'll be able to see 1,200 people every day,'' Brock told Los Angeles ABC affiliate KABC, ``but it's a question of mathematics.''
``There's so many millions of people in this country that just simply cannot afford the medical system,'' Brock continued. ``The word ??emote' does apply though, to the chances many, many people in this country have to obtain the care they need.''
This week, those chances just got a whole lot better for a few thousand needy Americans.
