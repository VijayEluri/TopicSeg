Life on Mars, if it ever existed, may be easier to find than previously thought. New research on terrestrial rocks suggests that a type of rock common on Mars can preserve fossilised microbial life, rather than erasing evidence of it as previously thought.
Minerals called sulphates, which form in the presence of liquid water, have been found in great abundance on Mars, including at the landing site of NASA's Opportunity rover, Meridiani Planum.
But it has been unclear whether sulphates could preserve evidence of ancient microbial life. The rocks form when sediment compacts and crystallises, a process that ??in other sedimentary rocks such as limestone ??can crush the edges of microscopic fossils, destroying evidence of their existence.
Now, Bill Schopf of the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues have used 3D imaging to reveal a range of fossilised algae in a type of sulphate called gypsum found in northern Italy. The gypsum formed when the Mediterranean Sea evaporated some 5.6 million years ago when tectonic activity temporarily cut it off from the Atlantic Ocean.
"We all assumed there wouldn't be anything in there, and we were wrong," Schopf told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday at the Astrobiology Science Conference in League City, Texas.
Finding such a "diverse assemblage of microfossils ??gives us great hope that the sulphates on Mars might harbour a similar kind of suite of fossils," says collaborator Jack Farmer of Arizona State University in Tempe.
'Significant find'
Because gypsum is soft, it should be fairly easy for a future Mars rover to scoop up. The sample could then be dissolved in water to hunt for organic chemicals that would hint at past life.
Alternatively, if the gypsum were brought back to Earth, it could be scanned for fossil structures using high-tech imaging equipment in the lab. That would require a multi-stage sample return mission, one of 28 missions currently being considered for future NASA funding by an advisory panel organised by the US National Research Council.
Rocks formed from evaporated water are good places to look for potential life on Mars, says Linda Kah of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. "This is a significant find," she told New Scientist.
But she adds that it is not clear how well such deposits can capture organic material when it is in short supply ??a likely scenario on Mars, which may have been habitable for only short periods of time or in specific locations. "Even though biologically produced materials are rampant on Earth, it is often very difficult to preserve," Kah told New Scientist.
