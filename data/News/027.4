The long-awaited real-time strategy game from Blizzard Entertainment, "Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty," now has an official release date: July 27.
The sequel to the 1998 hit "Starcraft" once again pits three races against one other: Terrans, the Zerg, and the Protoss. It'll offer a single-player game as well as a revamped Battle.net matchmaking system. The original game shipped more than 11 million copies, including one expansion, "Brood War."
The game has been in beta for more than a year, as Blizzard took the time to polish the gameplay before its release. The game will include 29 missions, plus several challenge mini-modes, Blizzard said.
In 2008, Blizzard said that "Wings of Liberty" would actually be the first chapter in an expected trilogy, with one game devoted to each race.
The game will be released in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Mexico, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Pricing has not been disclosed.
Screenshots and video can be found on the Starcraft 2 Web site.
