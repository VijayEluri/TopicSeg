Microscopic fossils from the dried-up seabed of the Mediterranean have led space scientists to seek similar evidence of ancient life in the red sands of Mars, where the rover named Opportunity is now exploring.
The scientists said they are impressed by the unexpected discovery of 6-million-year-old fossils in rocks from a time when the Mediterranean Sea was known to have dried up completely.
During a NASA phone briefing Wednesday, J. William Schopf, director of the Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life at UCLA, said the fossil life forms include organisms much like those in the oceans of today - phytoplankton, diatoms, and cyanobacteria, better known in a non-ocean environment as "pond scum."
They have all been discovered in gypsum, Schopf said - a common sulfate mineral where scientists never expected to find any signs of life.
"We all assumed there wouldn't be anything like life there," Schopf said, "and we were wrong."
Gypsum is made of calcium sulfate, and Steven Squyres, chief scientist of the Mars Rover mission, noted that Opportunity's six wheels are now carrying it across portions of an immense Martian region called Meridiani Planum, where sulfate rocks related to gypsum "literally carpet" the plain.
Those rocks, he said, would be a fine target for intense investigation.
Squyres is a member of a National Research Council task force weighing future concepts for space missions that would seek evidence of life - past or present - on planets or other bodies in the solar system like the larger asteroids that orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter.
Of eight possible missions in the top tier under consideration, Squyres said, one of particularly strong scientific interest would revive a 20-year-old plan to collect samples of Martian soil and return them to Earth for scientists to analyze in the best laboratories in the world.
The mission would involve three spacecraft launched over six years, Squyres said.
The first would be a rover that would trundle across a selected Martian site, collect a variety of soil samples, and then "park in a nice, safe spot" to await a second spacecraft from Earth that would pick up the samples, blast off from the planet's surface, and remain in Mars orbit until a third ship from Earth arrived to carry the priceless cargo back home.
The entire project, which Squyres described as "complex and hellishly difficult to complete," has no price tag yet, but NASA planners say the concept is being studied as a potential joint venture by teams at the European Space Agency's headquarters in Paris.
