Chimpanzees have been previously thought to process death in a detached, animalistic fashion. But new evidence shows that the animals mourn death much like humans, revealing that their awareness of death is much more developed than previously thought. Discovery News reports on two recently published studies showing the fine details on how chimps process the death of their companions and offspring. 
Biologists first cite the example of Pansy, a 50-year old chimp held in captivity at the Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling, Scotland. Researchers looked at how the three other chimps in Pansy's enclosure reacted when Pansy passed away of natural causes. Their behavior was decidedly changed from their normal patterns. As the study's lead author James Anderson told Discovery News, "In the days before Pansy died, the others were notably attentive towards her, and they even altered their routine sleeping arrangements to remain by her, by sleeping on the floor in a room where they don't usually sleep." 
As Pansy died, the other three chimps studied her face and shook her by the shoulders. After she passed away, a chimp named Chippy pounded on her torso. Researchers believed this was to determine how and if Pansy would react. In the end, Chippy sat quietly by Pansy's side, carefully removing straw from her face.
Another test showed chimp mothers reacted in a similar mournful fashion when their infants died of natural causes. Researchers from the University of Oxford watched a semi-isolated chimpanzee community that researchers had been studying for over three decades in the forests surrounding Bossou, Guinea. After their infants died of a flu-like disease, chimpanzee mothers Jire and Vuavua still carried and groomed their babies for up to 68 days. They only abandoned the bodies after researchers noted an extreme smell of decay.
Dora Biro is part of the University of Oxford study. As she told Discovery News, "Certainly in humans, the loss of loved ones is an immensely painful experience, and the loss of a child perhaps almost inconceivably so we probably experience feelings of a 'refusal to let go' even if we don't act on it in the same way as these mothers did." Biro points out that people often hold onto inanimate objects after a person's death, simply because they remind them of the deceased.
Researchers hope that their findings may help chimps in captivity deal with death in a more productive manner. Now, elderly or terminally ill chimpanzees are removed from their groups before they die. Ultimately, allowing them to remain in their normal habitat may be considered the most humane action of all.
