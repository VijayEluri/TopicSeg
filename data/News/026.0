NASA's shuttle Atlantis was cleared to take off on its final scheduled mission next week as the agency prepares to end the program amid a debate on the future of U.S. human space flight.
NASA managers set the launch for 2:20 p.m. local time on May 14 at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the agency said today. Atlantis is slated for a 12-day mission to deliver a Russian research module, spare parts and other cargo to the International Space Station. It will be the 32nd flight for Atlantis, which first flew in October 1985.
There are no more planned flights for Atlantis, though the orbiter will be prepared as a rescue vehicle for the final shuttle mission, which is scheduled to launch no earlier than November. The program was scheduled to be shut down under President George W. Bush's Constellation plan, which envisioned a return to the moon in new spacecraft as a stepping stone to further exploration of the solar system.
President Barack Obama in February announced a plan for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that scrapped Constellation and directed the agency to focus on developing rocket systems that might eventually take humans into deep space and helping private companies build vessels to carry astronauts into orbit.
The administration is working with legislators to craft the plan, which must be approved by Congress. The strategy has met with criticism from lawmakers in states with NASA operations, such as Florida and Texas, who say it surrenders leadership in space to other countries.
