Google Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and EBay Inc. won a victory for Web content providers as U.S. regulators agreed to claim authority over companies selling Internet access such as AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp.
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski plans to say today that the agency will extend rules used for telephone service to Internet providers, a commission official, who declined to be identified, said yesterday in an e- mailed statement. The agency will pledge to stop short of provisions such as the authority to control rates.
Genachowski wants to set net neutrality rules that would bar companies from favoring their own Web content and services, a goal of consumer advocacy groups. His power to do so was undermined when a U.S. court ruled on April 6 that the agency lacked authority to regulate Comcast's Internet practices.
AT&T is among Web service providers that say new regulations aren't needed and could damp investment. The companies probably will fight Genachowski in Congress and in court, said Jeffrey Silva, a Washington-based analyst with Medley Global Advisors LLC, in an interview.
The FCC ``is likely to set off a politically charged conflagration and deep-pocketed lobbying war'' pitting AT&T, Comcast and Verizon Communications Inc. against Google, Amazon and Web phone company Skype Technologies SA, Silva said.
FCC use of telephone-style rules is a ``nuclear option'' with ``sweeping implications that go far, far beyond net neutrality,'' Craig Moffett, a New York-based analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said yesterday. ``It would call into question virtually every assumption about the terminal value of networks, as they would be subject to enormous and unpredictable regulatory risk going forward.''
Consumers Protected
The decision will let the FCC ``ensure consumers are fully protected against blocking or degradation of websites and applications of their choice by broadband providers,'' said Markham Erickson, executive director of the Open Internet Coalition, in an e-mailed statement.
The coalition, with members including Google, EBay and Amazon, and consumer groups urged Genachowski to use the telephone rules in place of the regulations attacked in the Comcast case.
``This is a welcome announcement,'' said Gigi Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group, in an e-mailed statement.
Imposing phone rules ``would mark a radical and unlawful departure'' from 15 years of Internet policy under Republicans and Democrats, executives for AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc. and Time Warner Cable Inc. said in an April 29 letter to Genachowski. The same companies in a Feb. 22 letter to the FCC said invoking phone rules would have ``far-reaching and destructive consequences,'' including lawsuits.
??ajor Mistake'
Republicans questioned the FCC's assertion of authority.
Using ``outdated monopoly telephone rules is a major mistake,'' Senator John Ensign, a Nevada Republican, said in an e-mail. ``The government has taken over a lot of industries just this year, and the last thing that our economy needs right now is for the government to take over the Internet, too.''
Representative Henry Waxman of California and Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, who head each chamber's commerce committee, wrote Genachowski yesterday urging him to consider all options to retain authority over access providers. The Democrats said they may back a law giving the agency more power.
Genachowski ``has chosen a measured middle path and I support it,'' said Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, in an e-mailed statement.
``The turn-about in Internet policy would be radical,'' Randolph May, president of the Rockville, Maryland-based Free State Foundation that calls itself a free-market think tank, said in an e-mail. ``It would be a mistake of historic proportions.''
Michael Balmoris, a Washington spokesman for Dallas-based AT&T, the biggest U.S. phone company, and Sena Fitzmaurice, a Washington spokeswoman for Philadelphia-based Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, declined to comment.
