Pansy had a peaceful death. When the fiftysomething took to her bed, her son, daughter and an older friend gathered around her.
Moments after she died, they jostled her, then moved away from the deathbed. Finally, her daughter came back and laid down next to her mother's body but slept poorly. For the next five days, her son refused to set foot in the area where she had died.
A death surrounded by family and friends might not be remarkable, except that these were chimpanzees at the Blair Drummond Safari Park in Scotland, and this was the first time anyone had captured on video a chimpanzee group at the moment of a quiet death. "We were quite moved as we watched it unfold in real time," says James Anderson, a psychologist who studies primate behavior at the University of Stirling in Scotland.
The researchers publish an account of Pansy's death in today's edition of the journal Current Biology. Their account is paired with one describing the responses of two chimp mothers who lost babies in an outbreak of respiratory disease.
Anderson says researchers don't want to anthropomorphize the behavior, but the chimps' instinctive response to Pansy's death might be something that "predate(s) the religious or ritual significance we attach to our behaviors around death."
In many ways, it's not surprising, says Cheryl Knotts, a biological anthropologist at Boston University. It's possible to see the beginnings of many elements of human behaviors in chimpanzees and bonobos, such as tool use and communication.
These accounts "seem to show an attachment, a concern, for the dead or dying individual that is reminiscent of what we see in humans and possibly a precursor" to more elaborate awareness among humans, she says.
A second article, by researchers observing a small chimpanzee colony in Bossou, Guinea, in Africa, describes how the two chimp mothers continued to carry and care for the mummified remains of their babies for two months and three weeks, respectively, after they died.

The carrying of dead infants occurs in many primate species, says John Mitani, a primatologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. "It's curious behavior, and we don't quite understand what's going on."
Dora Biro, one of the zoologists who observed the chimpanzee community, says the best explanation she can give is that the mother-infant bond is so strong that the mothers are programmed by natural selection to never let go of the infant. "She can't give up the infant's body because she knows she must look after it," she says.
