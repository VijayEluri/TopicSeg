Gastric or stomach cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Over the last 50 years here in the United States, rates for this type of cancer have been declining in all ages and races, until now. A new study shows noncardia gastric cancer, found in the lower part of the stomach, is increasing in younger white Americans.
"The first thing you want to do is figure out a way to survive," said Glenda Reimer gastric cancer survivor.
Glenda Reimer, her sister Sandy Wilken, and Sandy's daughter, Mallorie, are very familiar with gastric cancer.
"Our dad died at 75, our brother died at 50, our cousin died at 50, she had young children, we get days that they did not," Sandy Wilken said.
They are at the National Cancer Institute, helping researchers better understand the disease. Reimer was diagnosed with cancer and lost her stomach. Sandy and Mallorie removed their stomachs because they were at high risk for developing the disease.
Dr. Charles Rabkin from the National Cancer Institute and co-authors studied gastric cancer rates in a quarter of U.S. adults, aged 25 to 84 for 30 years, from 1977 to 2006.
"The study confirmed the previously recognized decline in gastric cancer overall," Rabkin said.
The study appears in this week's JAMA, Journal of the American Medical Association.
"We did identify a worrying increase in the youngest age group of Caucasian 's 25 to 39 in whom cancers of the lower stomach actually increased about three percent per year," Rabkin said. "We're concerned that there may be either a new cause for gastric cancer in that population or perhaps some difference in their Helicobactor pylori infection that's contributing to a new risk for gastric cancer."
These women still don't know why the disease has gripped their family but they are determined to protect future generations by helping doctors figure it out and to live full and active lives.
"I have plenty of goals for my life and plenty of things that I want to do and just because I don't have a stomach or just because this is going on it' s not going to change any of that. It's not going to change me at all I'm not going to let it," said Mallorie Wilken.
Researchers say future studies are needed to identify risk factors that may explain this new trend.
