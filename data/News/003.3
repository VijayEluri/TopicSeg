Facebook's recent change involving access to user data  is attracting the attention of four U.S. senators -- and not in a good way. 
On Tuesday, Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Mark Begich (D-Alaska), and Al Franken (D-Minn.) urged the popular social-networking  site to revise its new policy of making some user data available to advertisers and other web sites unless the user opts out.
"Social-networking sites are a Wild West of the Internet," they said, adding that "users need the ability to control private information and fully understand how it's being used."
'Fundamentally Change the Relationship'
The Facebook changes were part of a rollout of new Facebook Platform tools announced last week. In particular, the "Like" button -- which reportedly is already widespread on participating sites -- opens up some user data to a site and its advertisers, unless a user decides against it.
On Sunday, Schumer said he has also contacted the Federal Trade Commission about providing guidelines for how social-networking sites can use and disseminate private information. "These recent changes by Facebook," his office said, "fundamentally change the relationship between the user and the social-networking site."
He noted that, previously, users had the ability to decide what information they could share and what they could keep private. Under the new policy, Schumer's office said, there's a "complicated and confusing opt-out process" for keeping private information from being shared with other sites, and users' interests are now automatically aggregated and shared.
'Making Unlimited Wealth' Not a Reason
The senators aren't the only government officials upset by Facebook's new policies.
Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart, who has been active in protesting privacy issues with such companies as Google, said she was "very concerned about these changes," in part because "half a million developers will have access to this data." Among other changes, Facebook had previously required third-party developers to delete user data after 24 hours, but now they can store it indefinitely.
This new approach, she said, "opens the possibility that a lot of people can be blackmailed from all corners of the world."
Stoddart said "bright young geeks" at Facebook, Google and other companies become enamored of the technology and ignore basic privacy rights. "Making unlimited wealth is not a reason for doing away with privacy," she has told news media.
Brad Shimmin, an analyst for industry research firm Current Analysis, said the senators' action "is an appropriate response" to this issue, since Facebook sometimes "acts like it's still being run out of a dorm room."
He said Facebook obviously needs to treat its members well, since their participation is what the company is about, but they "could be doing a better job." Shimmin added that, "as an analyst and as an individual, my feeling is that your data is your own" unless you decide otherwise.
Google's big mistake with its Google Buzz application, he said, was that it made users' address books available to friends as a default, when the default for Google, as with Facebook, should be that a user is opted-out.
