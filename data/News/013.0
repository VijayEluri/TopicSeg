It seems that what you eat can affect your waistline in more ways than one.
A recent study at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition has produced findings that show that spicy peppers can cause your body to burn more calories.
The study, which consisted of a group of 34 volunteers, contained two groups of people. Researchers gave the control group a placebo pill. They then gave the active group pills that contained dihydrocapsiate (DCT), which is a version of capsaicin. The pills were taken by volunteers before each meal. Each volunteer had their energy expenditure monitored.
What researchers found was that volunteers who took the pills containing DCT had the highest energy expenditure. This group's expenditure was almost double that of the group taking the placebo pills. They also burned more fat than the control group.
The reasoning behind these findings points to the fact that peppers contain capsaicin. This is a chemical that causes a person's pain receptors in their mouth to send messages to their brain in order to stop the pain. The brain, in turn, raises the person's adrenaline levels, which increasing their heart rate and causes them to perspire. These type reactions help to increase caloric burn.
While all peppers contain have some level of capsaicin, peppers that contain the most capsaicin are the jalapeno, habanera, and Serrano peppers. As a general rule of thumb, the hotter the pepper, the more capsaicin it contains.
It should be noted that the participants in this study were all on a low-calorie liquid weight-loss diet, so the results may vary for the average person with an average, solid food diet.
