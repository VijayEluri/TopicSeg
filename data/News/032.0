On the heels of a disappointing ad campaign, Yahoo is hoping to increase traffic to its home page and win back share in the Internet-search market with a new ad blitz that takes a shot at larger rival Google.
Yahoo says it will spend $75 million to $85 million on the push, which will promote Yahoo on TV, the Web and billboards as a one-stop Internet destination. The slogan: "Your favorite stuff all in one place. Make Yahoo your home page."
Fixing Yahoo's battered image has been a top priority for its chief executive, Carol Bartz. Just months after she took the reins last year, she unveiled with much fanfare a $100 million campaign with the tagline "It's You," focused on personalizing the online experience.
The campaign failed to increase traffic to Yahoo's home page or improve its share of the search market. In March, Ms. Bartz conceded it "didn't have a really good call to action."
Shortly after the campaign debuted last year, Yahoo ditched its ad agency, WPP PLC's Ogilvy & Mather, and hired Omnicom Group Inc.'s Goodby Silverstein & Partners. (Ogilvy & Mather still helps Yahoo in some markets outside the U.S.).
"Yahoo's mission now is to convince consumers that Yahoo is the place where you go to navigate the entire Web," says Jeff Goodby, co-chairman of Goodby.
To drill home that message, new ads will tout non-Yahoo Web destinations such as Facebook and celebrity gossip site Pop Sugar. One billboard features a man showing off his favorite websites. His tie bears the logos of sites such as Yahoo Travel, Yahoo Finance, Twitter and Flicker.
Not every website appears in a flattering light. One online video ad features an image of Google's home page-without the company's name. "When you look at this home page nothing looks back at you. You come to this place so you can leave," a voice-over says.
Then, as colorful Scrabble-like tiles adorned with various website logos come together to form women's faces, the voice-over praises Yahoo: "It doesn't hustle you out the door. It's a place that gets to know you, a place that finds things for you."
A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.
Yahoo's Chief Marketing Officer, Elisa Steele, says the aim is "to get people to interact with our products."
She defends last fall's campaign, saying it was intended to "bring Yahoo back into the conversation" and repair its image. "We were in an identity crisis," and the "brand's health," by such measures as consumers' likelihood to recommend it, was "in a four-year decline," she says.
The campaign, Ms. Steele adds, was successful in markets such as India, and has "neutralized the drop" in the brand's health in the U.S.
Indeed, Yahoo is sticking with the "It's You" tagline from that campaign. Yahoo considered proposals to change it, but Ms. Steele felt Yahoo just needed to give it "more context" so "people do feel like they get it."
The new campaign will include marketing gimmicks that give consumers the chance to try Yahoo products. This summer the company plans to place giant iPhones in movie theaters that will allow movie-goers to use Yahoo's sketch-a-search app to search for nearby restaurants.
Portable outdoor kiosks will be stationed around the country, allowing people to record video messages that can be sent through Yahoo Messenger, the company's instant-messaging service. The company also plans to set up a specially designed photo booth in New York's Times Square that will allow consumers to post pictures of themselves made up of tile-like website logos on a giant digital billboard and on Yahoo's home page.
Investors and analysts remain skeptical, however, that Ms. Bartz can turn around Yahoo by marketing alone. They say she needs to introduce new, more competitive products while continuing to cut costs. Internet companies generally build their followings through word of month. Few have changed their fortunes through marketing.
Yahoo has much riding on the campaign. Consumers' confusion about what the brand represents is Yahoo's "biggest weakness," says Jez Frampton, CEO of Interbrand, a branding firm owned by Omnicom. "The brand has dropped steadily over the past few years. They have to fix it."
The Sunnyvale, Calif., company, which still has one of the largest audiences on the Internet, saw the number of monthly unique visitors to its home page slide and its share of the U.S. search market shrink during its previous campaign.
Meanwhile, Google, which spent just $10 million on U.S. ads last year, according to a unit of WPP, had one of the Internet industry's best-received commercials. The ad, which told a romantic story through a man's Google searches, aired during the Super Bowl.
The commercial, dubbed "Paris," outscored Yahoo's "It's You" spots by a wide margin, according to Ace Metrix, a Los Angeles, Calif., research firm that uses an online panel of 500 people to gauge the effectiveness of ads.
Microsoft's Bing has also gained market share with the help a campaign in which people break into nonsensical rants that suggest they are overwhelmed by extraneous results produced by rival search engines.
