"Know your numbers" is the popular doctors' mantra to help patients understand risk for heart attack and stroke and traditionally includes measures for blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index and waist circumference. Now another number is under debate: coronary artery calcium score, or CACS.
New research suggests that the calcium score may be needed to accurately calculate risk -- though many doctors remain skeptical as to whether the test is worth its cost in health care dollars and radiation exposure.
Investigators at Northwestern University say they calculated CACS by using sophisticated imaging to visualize the amount of calcium found in the lining of arteries in the heart. In their study of 6,000 patients, researchers said the CACS score pushed more people into the high risk category than traditional risk factors alone -- specifically high levels of bad cholesterol or high blood pressure.
