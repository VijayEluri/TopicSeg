The study, which is being presented at the 2010 Experimental Biology conference, April 24 to 28, in Anaheim, Calif., shows that repetitive laughter has similar effects on the body as working out in the gym.
In the study, from Loma Linda University's Schools of Allied Health (SAHP) and Medicine, sessions of mirthful laughter - dubbed "Laughercise" by researchers, was not only found to enhance a person's positive mood, but it also lowered their stress hormones, stimulated immune activity, as well as lowered blood pressure and levels of 'bad' cholesterol, similar to moderate physical exercise, according to UK's Daily Mail.
Study details
For the study, lead researcher Dr. Lee S. Berk, who is a preventive care specialist and psycho-neuro-immunology researcher at Loma Linda University's Schools of Allied Health and Medicine in California, along with a colleague, recruited 14 healthy volunteers to watch two 20-minute videos - one distressing and one humorous-- over a three-week period.
To determine if the videos that the volunteers watched had an effect on them, the researchers measured their blood pressure and levels of two appetite hormones, leptin and ghrelin, before and after watching the videos.
Study results
The researchers noticed no change in the blood of participants who watched the distressing video but after watching the comedy video there were noticeable changes.
Watching the humorous clip caused changes in blood pressure and led levels of appetite hormones leptin and ghrelin to change.
Laughercise effects are similar to physical exercise
The effects seen were similar to the way appetite can intensify during and after moderate physical exercise, the study authors say.
"The ultimate reality of this research is that laughter causes a wide variety of modulation, and that the body's response to repetitive laughter is similar to the effect of repetitive exercise. The value of the research is that it may provide for those who are healthcare providers with new insights and understandings, and thus further potential options for patients who cannot use physical activity to normalise or enhance their appetite," Dr Berk said.

The authors of the study say that people suffering from wasting diseases, chronic pain and depression could benefit from trying this "Laughercise" therapy to regain their hunger.
