Buying an external hard drive for extra computer storage usually involves determining the type of drive connection you need (USB, FireWire, eSATA), and formatting the drive so it will work on a PC or a Macintosh, but not both.
The new family of FreeAgent GoFlex drives that manufacturer Seagate has just unveiled promises consumers more flexibility if their storage requirements change.
First off, you can update these portable drives just by swapping out the cable adapter and replacing the cable -- in that way, a USB 2.0 drive can be upgraded to USB 3.0, eSATA or FireWire 800 connections. Other optional cables can turn the drive into an automatic backup system. It's loosely analogous to those universal battery chargers that provide different tips to juice up different devices.
Moreover, Seagate is adding a so-called NTFS driver for Mac OS X that will let users store and access files form both Windows PCs and Macs.
Prices for ultraportable GoFlex drives range from $100 for a 320 gigabyte version up to $200 for a terabyte. They come with a USB 2.0 cable. A larger desk-size external drive kit with a USB 2.0 cable and encrypted backup costs $120 for 1TB and $200 for 2TB. Various plug and play cables and adapters range from about $20 to $50.
Seagate also sells GoFlex devices for sharing media on a home network and for displaying high definition content on a TV.
