The proposed US climate change bill may be teetering on the brink of collapse, but that has not stopped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) going on the offensive this week with a new report designed to demonstrate the extent to which climate change is already affecting the US.
The EPA yesterday published a report on Climate Change Indicators in the United States, which analysed 24 key signs to show how climate change is having an impact on the nation's health and environment.
The report appears to be a direct response to the flurry of legal action that has engulfed the agency since it ruled last year that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and can therefore be regulated by the EPA under the existing Clean Air Act.
That so-called "endangerment finding" is being challenged by a number of states and business groups, which argue that either the climate science the ruling was based on is flawed, or that the EPA failed to follow correct legal procedures when making the decision.
The EPA has rejected the charges and is vowing to fight each of the legal challenges, as well as efforts by a number of senators to strip it of its new powers.
To date the EPA has attempted to somewhat appease its critics by delaying plans to impose new rules on carbon-intensive power stations and industrial plants designed to ensure they use efficient equipment.
But yesterday the agency attempted to get back on the front foot, defending the science and providing further evidence that climate change is already having a detrimental effect on health.
The report shows that average temperatures in the US are rising, with seven of the top 10 warmest years on record having occurred since 1990, and confirms that as a result tropical cyclone intensity has increased in recent decades, wh ile sea levels rose twice as fast as the long-term trend between 1993 and 2008.
It also shows that the frequency of heat waves has risen steadily since the 1960s, while the percentage of the US population affected by heat waves has also increased and that between 2001 and 2009 about 30 to 60 per cent of the US was experiencing drought conditions.
The report concludes that there is scientific evidence that climate change is making 22 of the 24 indicators worse, and that many of the changes pose a direct threat to human health. For example, the report states that "for society, increases in temperature are likely to increase heat-related illnesses and deaths, especially in urban areas".
"These indicators show us that climate change is a very real problem with impacts that are already being seen," said Gina McCarthy, assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. "The actions Americans are taking today to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help us solve this global challenge."
Should the proposed US climate bill collapse following Republican senator Lindsey Graham's decision to withdraw support for the draft bill, the EPA will take a central role in the Obama administration's plans to regulate carbon emissions.
The EPA's endangerment finding has long been regarded by the Obama administration as its "plan B" for regulating emissions should the climate bill fail, and given the current stand-off over the climate bill, it appears increasingly likely that pressure will increase on the EPA to step up its regulation of emissions.
