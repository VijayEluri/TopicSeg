Microsoft said Tuesday that it has released the first version of its Windows 7 operating system for industrial and consumer manufacturers.
End users probably won't encounter the somewhat awkwardly named Windows Embedded Standard 7 operating system as much as the Windows Phone 7 or Windows 7 operating systems for the phone and PC, respectively.
The Windows Embedded Standard 7 OS was first introduced in January, when both Intel and Microsoft collaborated on a retail proof-of-concept interactive sign that could recognize users by their physical attributes (a man or a woman) and interactive features such as panning and zoom, touch, and gesture input. The OS also supports remote management features, plus power management as well.
Microsoft said that the interactive retail sign was now available for purchase. Other target markets include retail and hospitality, industrial automation, and the medical industry; in another proof of concept, Siemense and Microsoft created an intelligent production line.
"Building on the strength of Windows for PCs and Windows for phones, we are upgrading our entire portfolio of platforms and technologies for the embedded market with Windows 7 technologies to better serve our partners and customers in the embedded space," Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president of the OEM division of Microsoft, wrote in a blog post.
More details about the Windows Embedded Standard 7 OSwill be released at the Computex show in Taipei in June.
