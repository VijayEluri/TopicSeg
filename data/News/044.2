The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have released a warning pertaining to defibrillators that are not working properly.
External defibrillators are used to restart the hearts of people who suffer sudden cardiac arrest, via electric shock.
These devices are becoming more and more popular and are being installed in some public places, and are commonly found in hospitals, nursing homes and other long term care facilities.
The FDA says that defective parts of 14 models of defibrillators made by Cardiac Science Corp. may actually result in them not working properly, a fact that could make the difference when it comes to determining if a person lives or dies.
They say as many as 280,000 devices could be faulty, and urge nursing homes and other medical centers to take steps to test their devices or even purchase brand new ones if possible.
