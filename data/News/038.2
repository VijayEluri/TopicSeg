Just one bad night of sleep could have a substantial impact on your body.
A good night's sleep has long been touted as a way to help protect your health. Now, a new report finds just one sleepless night may mess with the body's ability to use insulin. Scientists say this might explain why diabetes is on the rise.
While sleep duration has decreased in western societies there has also been an increase in cases of insulin resistance and adult onset diabetes.
The findings in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism showed partial sleep restriction for just one night decreased insulin sensitivity by 19-25 percent.
Adults are typically advised to get at least seven to nine hours of sleep a night.
