Facebook is feeling some political heat for its moves last week, after launching a program that "instantly personalizes" websites for visitors by automatically sharing user data with the site owner.
Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) wrote a letter to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg asking him and the company to revisit their decision on the program and move to an "opt in" default rather than an "opt out" one.
Facebook first mentioned the "instant personalization" program in a privacy policy released for public comment last month. After receiving hundreds of user comments (but not the level of outrage it saw when it unveiled the news feed four years ago), it approved the policy. While the program doesn't share a user's entire profile, it has ability to pass on information including a user's name, their friends' names, profile pictures, gender, connections, and content shared under the "Everyone" privacy setting. Although the company had planned to unveil the program with a wider number of partners, it ultimately winnowed the number to just three, with Microsoft, Pandora and Yelp.
The senator has also reached out to the Federal Trade Commission, arguing that there are few guidelines for privacy on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter or that they are often difficult to understand. He added that if the FTC feels it lacks the authority to issue guidelines, he would back legislation giving them the power to do so.
