One more week to go before the space shuttle Atlantis sets off on its final mission. NASA today set May 14 as the launch date for the craft's last flight to the International Space Station. Liftoff time is set for 2:20 p.m. as Atlantis will fly a crew of six and a load of supplies.
As previously reported, NASA is putting its three shuttles into retirement. Following this flight, there are two more missions scheduled for this year.
