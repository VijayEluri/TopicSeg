The most valuable real estate on the Internet, the starting point for more than 1 billion Google searches a day, is getting its most substantial renovation in years. Even one of the world's most familiar logos is about to look a little different.
Google is changing the function, look and feel of its search and results pages - offering new navigational tools that will automatically customize themselves to individual searches, enlarging its search box, and following the lead of other search engines that display their results in three vertical columns. Calling the changes a "spring metamorphosis" in its official blog, Google is even tweaking the look of its colorful logo - the first substantial alteration since 1999 in the bouncy blue, red, yellow and green logo originally designed by co-founder Sergey Brin.
"We want Google to continue to look simple," Patrick Riley, technical lead for Web search at the Mountain View search giant, said of the changes to the results page, which will be gradually phased in globally this week. "We were trying to focus on a clean and simple and modern look. That's what many of the changes on the results page were about."
Of course, under the hood, Google is anything but simple, and the most significant changes are functional - a series of navigational tools in a new left-hand column of the results page offering links to specialty search engines such as "Images," "News," "Blogs" and "Shopping" that the search engine will automatically mix and match to the user's query. Another new tool, "Something Different" offers a selection of related subjects - a search for "Rolling Stones," for example, offers a "Something Different" result of aging rockers Aerosmith, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.
Yahoo, Microsoft's Bing and Ask already display results in three distinct columns split between sponsored advertising links, main search results and navigational tools. While Google holds a commanding market share in search, rolling up nearly $16 billion in search advertising revenue last year, experts said even the leader had to tinker with the uncluttered doorstep it has clung to since the late 1990s.
"Google now is in the role of a trailer in the user interface," said Hadley Reynolds, director of search and digital marketplace technology for the research firm IDC. Given Google's market share - Experian Hitwise reported Wednesday that Google had 71 percent of U.S. Internet searches in April, taking share from Yahoo, Bing and Ask -"it's OK for them to be a trailer," Reynolds said, "but they couldn't wait forever" to make changes.
"I feel like it has made Google a bit more modern - a bit more 2010-ish if you will," said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land, a website the follows the search business. Like other observers, he praised the utility of the new navigational tools.
"They are definitely responding to the competition," added Ray Valdes, an analyst with Gartner. "It's necessary; in fact, one might even say it's overdue."
Unlike Facebook, which has made major changes to the basic design of its pages and dealt with a backlash each time, Google invests a huge amount of time in user testing and data collection before making even the most minute change to its search pages. For months, some Google users have seen the new logo and tools pop up unexpectedly in their browser, as Google has tested how users respond to the changes. And given the visibility of these changes, they are highly significant, analysts said.
"Legend has it that before they decided on this particular shade of blue they tested 51 similar shades of blue to see which was the most effective," Valdes said.
Part of the goal, Riley said, is to make Google feel easier to use by having more consistency in the look of the results page across different kinds of searches. "When people end up on blog search for the first time, they aren't going to have to figure out how this thing works, because it's going to work like Google," Riley said.
The changes to the logo are subtle, and include dropping the "TM" from the tail of "Google," a change Riley said was made to better emphasize its simplicity of design. Google also removed shading around the logo's six letters, brightening them into simpler shapes with "softer gradients."
Google's sponsored advertising links on the top and right side of the results page, the source of all those billions of dollars in search ad revenue, will also get a new color backdrop - dubbed "cosmic latte." True as ever to its zeal for science and data, Google had a scientific rationale for the choice.
"It's the average color," Riley said of cosmic latte, "of all the radiation of the universe."
