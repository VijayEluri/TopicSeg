MICROSOFT will take advantage of the popularity of social networking with the launch of its new web messenger.
Windows Live Messenger is just the first of a range of new services launching in Australia over the coming months.
"The new Windows Live focuses on aggregating social networks to help individuals and their friends facilitate more meaningful conversations and social experiences,'' the company said in a statement.
The new version will link updates from social networking favourites such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn.
Australian general manager of Nielsen Online, Matt Bruce, said Messenger is a hugely popular tool in Australia.
"Along with email, it's one of the big assets of NineMsn here, so they continue to upgrade it to keep their users happy,'' Mr Bruce said.
In Australia about 125 million messages are sent each day using Messenger.
