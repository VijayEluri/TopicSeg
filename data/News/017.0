The outbreak of the H1N1 pandemic, exaggerated or not, resulted in the stockpiling of vaccines that it now seems nobody wants. 
The volume of the virus itself has now seemed to have greatly diminished. ``Right now, we're experiencing lower levels than we would normally expect to see with the seasonal virus.  The primary we're getting now is still H1N1, but we're at such a low level of individuals reporting it, that it's considered very mild,'' says Ryan Pedigo, director of public health preparedness at the Hillsborough County Health Department. 
Likewise, the demand for the H1N1 vaccine has sharply dropped: ``Right after Thanksgiving, our demand dropped by 80 percent and we're not really sure exactly why, but people didn't want it after that,'' said Pedigo.  Apparently this is a nationwide trend, as it has been reported that in the U.S. alone as many as 60 to 70 million H1N1 vaccines are either expired or will expire soon.  Doctor's are still urging patients to receive the vaccines, though hopefully not the expired ones.
