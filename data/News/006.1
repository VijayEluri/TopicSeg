Google on Tuesday added to its acquisition roster with the purchase of Labpixies, which publishes Web and mobile applications.
Labpixies was one of the first companies to create gadget for iGoogle back in 2005.
"Over the years, we worked closely together on a variety of projects, including the launch of a number of global OpenSocial based gadgets," Dan Loeb with the iGoogle team wrote in a blog post. "Recently, we decided that we could do more if we were part of the same team, and as such, we're thrilled to announce the acquisition of Labpixies."
The Labpixies team will be based in Google's Tel Aviv office and will focus on iGoogle efforts across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, Loeb wrote.
"We both felt the time was right to come together," Labpixies wrote on its Web site. "We started Labpixies to create a truly personalized online experience and develop fun widgets that people find useful every day. Working at Google will help us scale to more users as well as giving our team greater opportunities."
"The acquisition is an opportunity to learn from each other to bring more apps to users, help developers and improve the overall developer ecosystem," Labpixies said.
Labpixies said there are no plans to change current products, but the company will evaluate this over time.
Labpixies is the latest in a string of small acquisitions for Google. This year, Google has acquired visual search company Plink, purchased iPhone e-mail app ReMail, photo-editing site Picnik, and platform services company Episodic.
Last year, Google acquired mobile display advertising firm AdMob, display ad company Teracent, and CAPTCHA test company reCaptcha.
