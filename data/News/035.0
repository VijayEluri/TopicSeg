Skype on Wednesday introduced subscription plans that it said will allow for cheaper calls to international cell phones and landlines.
Starting Thursday, Skype users will be able to sign up for subscriptions in more than 170 countries, with plans as little as $1.09 per month.
Options include unlimited calls to U.S.- and Canada-based cell phones and landlines for $2.95 per month, unlimited calls to landlines in 39 countries (not the U.S.) for $5.95, or unlimited calls to over 40 countries worldwide (including U.S. mobiles and landlines) for $12.95 per month.
Users can choose packages that allow calls to just one country, a region like Europe or Canada, or a selection of countries. They can be purchased in one month, three month, or one year bundles and subscriptions will be renewed automatically unless you cancel.
A subscription also includes voicemail and call forwarding.
Currently, Skype offers free Skype-to-Skype calls on PCs and mobile phones. For those without Skype, the company also offers Skype Credit, which allows users to call landlines and cell phones using those credits. Wednesday's announcement will let users purchase service bundles for unlimited calling.
Subscriptions can be purchased with credit cards, PayPal, bank transfers, and other local payment methods. Skype Credit can also be applied to a Skype subscription.
While Skype says that its plans offer unlimited calling, there are fair usage policy restrictions, though you'd have to be quite the conversationalist to bump up against the limits. Users are restricted to 10,000 minutes of talk time per month and a maximum of six hours per day. Users are also not allowed to call more than 50 different phone numbers in one day. If these limits are exceeded, Skype will charge its normal rates.
These rules apply to calls made to landlines and cell phones in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and the U.S. They also apply to landline calls to 37 additional countries, which are listed on the Skype Web site.
