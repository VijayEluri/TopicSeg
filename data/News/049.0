Long-term steroid use may be more dangerous than previously thought, according to a new report.
Researchers with the Massachusetts General Hospital said prolonged taking of anabolic steroids may weaken the heart and increase the chances of heart failure. Steroids mimic naturally-occurring testosterone.
Dr. Aaron L. Baggish, the lead author of the study, said the left ventricle, which is the heart's main pumping chamber, was significantly weaker during contraction in study participants who reported long-term steroid use.
The steroid users in the study were 12 male weight lifters, with an average age of 40. They reported taking about 675 milligrams of steroids a week for nine years. The control group consisted of seven weight lifters of the same age who reported never taking steroids.
Almost all -- 83 percent ??of the steroid group had low pumping capacity in their left ventricles, prompting Baggish and his colleagues to conclude steroid-use is a heart health risk factor.
The study is published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Heart Failure.
