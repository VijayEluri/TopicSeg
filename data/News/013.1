A recent study has revealed that consumption of pepper in routine diet may help people lose weight. According to www.sciencedaily.com, pepper contains a substance known as capsaicin which leads to heating up of the body that has been linked to weight loss. The study also mentions certain other natural alternatives for people who do not like the burning sensation that pepper causes. Dihydrocapsiate (DCT), a close cousin of capsaicin does not cause burning sensation but lends a helping hand in weight loss. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition.
As reported by www.physorg.com, the study was carried out on a group of 34 women and men who were kept on low-calorie diet which included mainly liquid meal for a period of 28 days. The body weight and fat level of the people were examined before the study. Half of the group was made to consume placebo pills together with the low-cal diet while the remaining half was given non-burning pepper DCT.
A considerable increase in the energy expenditure was recorded in the group which consumed DCT as compared to the Placebo group. In addition, the DCT intake resulted in fat oxidation and high metabolic rate. As per the researchers this has been the first study which has tapped onto the potential of DCT pepper which might help to lose weight when consumed together with a low calorie diet.
Celebrities who have battled weight issues include Kirstie Alley, Wynonna Judd, Oprah Winfrey and Sharon Osbourne.
