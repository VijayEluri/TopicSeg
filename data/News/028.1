Take this, Luke Wilson - according to a new survey, AT&T drops more calls than any other wireless carrier, despite having faster download speeds and a monopoly on iPhone service.
In a standard test from PC World, AT&T was found to have the fastest download speeds, at an average of 140 kilobits per second. 
But on average, in a survey from ChangeWave Research, AT&T also had the most dissatisfies customers. Subscribers reported that 4.5% of their calls were dropped, on average. That's a huge jump above the undignified runner-up, T-Mobile, at 2.8%. 
Sprint users reported an average call-drop percent of 2.4%, while Verizon was at the very bottom of the list at 1.5%. However, Verizon was also the lowest when it came to clocking download speeds. Its downloads were slower than any other carrier. 
In terms of overall satisfaction, though, Verizon ranked highest. Even at the top spot, though, only 49% of Verizon subscribers said they are "very satisfied" with their provider, so that goes to show just how much the mobile phone industry is doing in terms of providing a quality service. 
Sprint had the second-highest rating, followed by T-Mobile at 23%. AT&T, you bet, was at the bottom, tied with T-Mobile at 23% of its customers being very satisfied. When the iPhone comes to Verizon, AT&T better watch out!
