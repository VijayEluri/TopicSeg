Google users around the world will soon be seeing a new search page.
The Mountain View online giant has streamlined the design of its main site and added a handful of search refinement tools in an effort to allow surfers to more easily navigate the Internet.
"The Web is continually evolving and adapting, users are continually evolving and adapting, and the search engine needs to do the same," said Nundu Janakiram, product manager for search at Google Inc.
Many of the changes are pure design, including a brighter corporate logo and colorful icons along the left-hand panel for filtering content by categories such as images, books and blogs. In addition, the company worked to make the layout and feel of the pages more unified as a user jumps from one category to the next.
But there's also technology being introduced or at least showcased by the redesign, including algorithms that select the appropriate refinement tools to serve up based on the query or category, Janakiram said.
For instance, searches of blogs can be narrowed by time down to the last 10 minutes, news to the last hour and books to within a century. Images searches can be refined by size, color and type, including face, photo or clip art.
Another new tool points to related topics, actually broadening rather than refining the query. For example, a search for Rolling Stones would return links for Aerosmith, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.
