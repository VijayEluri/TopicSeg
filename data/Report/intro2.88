Growth in plants is determined in large part by the synthesis and distribution of several hormones within the individual.
Although there are many specific types, they are grouped together based on the effects they have on the development of plants.
Auxins inhibit cell elongation in root tissue, while they promote cell elongation in plant shoots.
Cytokinins are responsible for cell division and organogenesis in plant tissues.
Gibberellins promote seed germination, internode elongation, and floral development.
Ethylenes are a very economically important class of hormones because they are responsible for the ripening of fruit and the abscission of tree leaves in the fall.
Abscisic acids are water conservation hormones that help plants conserve water in times of drought.
Pea plants are ideal for experimentation because they grow quickly, small in size, have easily observed features, and are cost effective to grow in quantity.
In this experiment, unknown growth compounds will be applied to pea plants in order to determine what effects the compounds have on the resulting development of the pea plants.
Several questions that will be investigated in this experiment are what effect the compounds have on the number of internodes present on a pea plant and their lengths in comparison to a control group of plants after one week of growth.
Based on these results, it is expected to show whether the compound was a hormone that promoted internode formation and elongation, or a growth inhibitor that inhibited internode formation and elongation.
It is expected that there will be a difference between the experimental groups and the control group, and these growth differences will aid in the determination of the experimental substance.
