Plants like animals are sensory and respond to their environment when presented with a stimulus.
Plants respond to various environmental tropisms and hormone signaling by varying their patterns of growth and development.
Unlike animals, plants exhibit indeterminate growth and continue to grow and differentiate through out their entire life.
Plants exhibit four properties: Modular, Plasticity, indeterminate growth and a replace and regenerate strategy.
They show modifications by sensing their environment and show different response to different tropisms.
Plants are extremely plastic, can take any shape depending on the environment.
They show indeterminate growth and grow through replacing the damaged organelle and regenerating the organelles themselves (Raven, Johnson, 796).
Apart from environmental responding, plants also have internal hormones which are in small quantities and targets specific tissues.
Each hormone has a different kind of effect than the other depending on the site of action and developmental stage of the plant (Cyr, Paradise).
There are five major hormones involved with plant growth: Auxin.
Cytokinin.
Gibberellin.
Ethylene.
Abscisic acid.
Auxin is one of the major hormones which facilitate stem elongation.
Indole 3-acetic acid is the only known naturally occurring auxin.
IAA is also involved in the phototropic response of plants that causes them to grow toward light.
Auxin is produced in the apical meristem of the plant and is located at the apex.
Auxin also contributes to the problem of Apical dominance, which is the suppression of the growth of lateral buds.
The other stimulating hormone is Cytokinin, which stimulate cell division and elongation.
They are synthesized in the roots and move upwards.
Cytokinin promotes root branching and the ratio of Cytokinin/auxin balance is also important for control of apical dominance.
Gibberellin is also a stimulator which is naturally occurring plant hormones.
They promote stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Very high concentration of gibberellins causes plants to grow very tall which is known as bolting and low concentration amounts causes dwarfism (Cyr, Paradise).
Abscisic acid is an inhibitor produced in the terminal buds.
This hormone inhibits the bud growth and promotes seed dormancy and helps closure of stomata resulting in water conservation.
Another group of inhibitor hormones is Ethylene, a gaseous compound which ripens the fruit and acts as growth inhibitor.
It also helps in the abscission of leaves.
In this experiment, the effects of these various hormones on the growth of the plant will be determined.
The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effects of unknown compounds on plant growth, especially with branching and stem elongation and identifying the unknown compounds.
The hypothesis of this experiment is that inhibiting hormones such as Abscisic acid and Ethylene will reduce the size of the plant, length of an average internode and number of internodes and the stimulating hormones like Auxin, Cytokinin and Gibberellin will promote these qualities of a plant.
The collected and analyzed data will show the effects of hormones on plant growth and development.
