The agreed-upon idea that "plants sustain all of life on earth" is a fairly well known theory.
No matter where you go or what you do, you are bound to see and interact with a plant.
The question at hand is that how do plants grow and function with everyday life?
In this lab we studied the effects of tropisms and plant hormones on the growth of plants.
The definition of a tropism is a growth response of plants due to environmental cues or external stimuli (Lab Manual).
There are variations of tropisms such as phototropism (light), Gravitropism (gravity), and Thigmotropism (touch) (Lab Manual).
The other effect on a plants growth is known as Plant Growth Regulators or PGR.
PGR are naturally or synthetic substances that regulate or influence cell division, cell differentiation, root or shoot growth, flowering, and senescense (Horticulture, Schroeder).
These pgr's can either be promoters or inhibitors of plant growth.
The naturally occurring forms are known as plant hormones.
Plant hormones are chemical messengers that are produced by a plant tissue than transported to other plant parts where they regulate growth (Horticulture, Schroeder).
A few main plant hormones are Auxin (IAA), Gibberellins (GA), and Cytokinins.
Auxins are growth promoting hormones produced in by meristematic cells in terminal buds (Horticulture, Schroeder).
As they move down the stem, they control certain plant responses like cell division and growth (Horticulture, Schroeder).
Yet in high concentrations, auxin can prevent development of side buds creating what is known as Apical Dominance (Horticulture, Schroeder).
Auxin also is a main component in geo and phototropism (Horticulture, Schroeder).
Gibberellins (GA) stimulate stem growth (bolting), promote elongation, promote cell division and control enzyme release (Horticulture, Schroeder).
Cytokinins are organic compounds that affect cell division and enlargement, tissue differentiation, dormancy, leaf aging, and leaf dropping (Horticulture, Schroeder).
They also slow down senescence by preventing the breakdown of chlorophyll in the leaves (Horticulture, Schroeder).
The questions that are asked in this lab are basically, what plant hormone was sprayed on our plants that made them react and grow the way they did throughout the two weeks.
The purpose of this lab is to associate the lab students with plant hormones and show to us how they affect plant growth.
This data should show that a plant with higher concentrations of a plant hormone, with the exception of too much auxin, should be tall with more internodes than the control plant or the plant with less of the hormone added.
