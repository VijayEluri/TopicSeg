Plants adapt and respond to various environmental conditions just like humans and animals.
They are mobile, but are confined to a particular area that they'll dwell in their entire life span.
Plants respond to environmental conditions by altering their patterns of growth, which is indeterminate, and altering their development.
Plants are indeterminate, meaning that they can grow and differentiate their whole life, in turn adapting to their surroundings and developing more patterns of growth.
Their main goal, however, is to maximize the reproductive success (Burpee, 2004).
All plants have hormones that aid in the development of growth patterns and sizes.
They play an important role in affecting cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, and other plant characteristics.
The five major common plant hormones are Auxins (Indole 3-acetic acid), which promotes elongation by stimulating the cells.
This leads to apical dominance (stimulation of roots/suppression of buds).
Cytokinins (Adenine) stimulate cell differentiation and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
Gibberellins promote inter-node growth and ABA (abscisic acid) is released under dry conditions, inhibiting the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
Ethylene is a gaseous inhibitor that functions in the aging process (senescence) (Burpee, Leicht, 2004).
Besides hormones, other external factors such as tropisms can influence the growth pattern of plants.
Among the tropisms, are Thigmotropism (influenced by touch or force in a certain direction), Gravitropism, and Phototropism, which influence the rate and growth patterns (Johnson, Ch. 41: 808-810).
One question that can be taken into consideration is if the tropisms predominate over one another, and if so, how might it be determined which one.
Also the position of the plant should be analyzed to see if it affects the tropic response.
The direction of the light source, along with the type of hormone should also be taken into consideration, when measuring the phototropic response.
The main purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effects of light, gravity, and touch, as well as unknown compounds on plants, by plotting and observing counts and trends on graphs.
The percent difference can also reveal the distinction between experimental plants and control plants.
The compounds can be compared to the different responses and outcomes of the plants.
The outcome of each tropism will be negatively or positively directly proportional to the type of unknown compound present along with natural hormones.
For example, a plant that undergoes thigmotropism, on top of being treated with a compound that stimulates elongation in the internodes and shoots and has natural stimulating hormones (auxin, gibberellic acid, cytokinins), will definitely show greater change in positioning and growth, in comparison to a plant that is treated with a inhibitory compound.
Since phototropism and gravitropism are almost unavoidable, unless the plant is growing under dark conditions, thigmotropism will probably dominate.
However, if the side exposed to light, was to undergo thigmotropism on the exact same side, the plant would curve even more towards the light.
Phototropism and thigmotropism have an agonistic, while gravity is independent and may be opposing or in favor of the situation.
Shoots always oppose the direction that gravity is going (negative gravitropism).
The orientation of the plant doesn't affect the strength of the tropic response, because not considering roots, the shoots will always demonstrate negative growth, and the plants will always go towards the light.
It is depended on the direction/location of the light source.
If it is shining on one side, the plant will move in that direction because of the rapid production of cells on the darker side.
Plant hormones secreted from within plant can affect the rate and degree of tropisms on the plant.
For example, when ABA is secreted the plant stops growing to conserve water.
The tropisms will still have an effect under these circumstances, but under a slower rate (Johnson, 2002).
