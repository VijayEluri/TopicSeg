While both plants and animals are both considered to be living organisms and share many of the same challenges such as the need to reproduce, attain nourishment, and be able to monitor their environment and make the appropriate responses to it, the way they overcome and adapt to these challenges are often very different.
This is because animals' growth is typically limited and governed by predetermined factors such genetics which take generations to develop physical modifications.
Plants on the other hand, show indeterminate growth; they are for the most part free of genetic limitations in growth and development.
They are also more environmentally sensitive and thus exhibit more of a plastic type of development-it can be easily changed with varying environmental conditions.
The environmental sensitivity and plasticity of plants is due largely in part to the fact that plants are cessile, and cannot move.
Therefore, all responses to the environment must be developmental wherein adaptations come in the form of modifications to growth and development.
These modifications are controlled by compounds known as plant hormones.
A hormone is a substance that is produced in one area of an organism and regulates the growth or functioning of a specific tissue or organ in a distant part of the organism.
Plant hormones are essentially divided into seven categories.
They are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, and oligosaccharides, and each affects plants in their own unique way (Campbell, 1993).
However, it can be questioned as to exactly how each of these hormones affects plants in terms of growth and development.
A study was conducted to observe the effects of two unknown plant hormone compounds on plant growth through changes in plant height, number of internodes, and average length of new internodes in pea seedlings.
It is expected that neither of the two unknown compounds will have a significant effect on plant height, number of new internodes formed, or the average length of the new internodes in the plants.
