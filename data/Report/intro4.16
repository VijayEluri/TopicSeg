A hormone is a molecule, usually a peptide or steroid, that is produced in one part of an organism that triggers a specific response in another organ or system some distance away (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Plant hormones are unique in that they are produced in a variety of areas in the plant and they can be used in a number of different tissues ("Control of Plant Growth: Plant Hormones and Tropisms", 2004).
There are five major classes of plant hormones; auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene.
Each hormone plays a unique and important role in plant development.
Through this experiment we are trying to identify one plant hormone and its inhibitor.
Auxins are any chemical substance that is related to the elongation of shoots in plants.
There is only one naturally occurring auxin and it is synthesized by the apical meristem of a plant and moves down the shoot to the area of elongation where is stimulates cell growth.
Auxins also suppress lateral bud growth giving plants the appearance of Christmas trees (Apical dominance).
Auxins also cause plants to "lean" toward light sources in phototropic responses (Burpee, 2004).
Cytokinins are the group of hormones that stimulate cell division and help to define the pathway of differentiation (Burpee, 2004).
Cytokinins also stimulate morphogenesis (shoot initiation and bud formation) and the growth of lateral buds which is why there is more branching near the ground than near the apex of a plant.
It causes even more branching in the roots of the plant than in the shoots ("Cytokinins", 2004).
Gibberellins stimulate stem elongation by stimulating cell elongation and division.
They work with auxins in the elongation of cells in the shoots of plants.
High concentrations of gibberellins cause bolting, which is when the plant grows tall quickly.
Gibberellins can also cause the development of seedless fruits and can delay the senescence in leaves and certain fruits ("Gibberellins", 2004).
Abscisic acid (ABA) stimulates the closure of stomata, which plays a role in the conservation of water and the uptake of gases from the atmosphere.
ABA also has some effect on the induction of dormancy when conditions for plant growth and activity are not favorable.
Plants in areas where drought is common normally show high concentrations of ABA ("Abscisic acid", 2004).
Ethylene is a gaseous hormone; the only gaseous hormone in plants.
It stimulates the release of dormancy, and the abscission of leaves and fruit.
Ethylene stimulates flower and leaf senescence as well as fruit ripening which eventually causes the abscission of these plant parts ("Ethylene", 2004).
The purpose of this lab is to determine what hormone is being used to treat the plants in treatment one and which inhibitor is being used in treatment two.
This can be determined by collecting data on how the plants grow; including the total plant height, the number of internodes on each plant and the length of the internodes.
I hypothesize that if the plants grow tall in one week's time then the hormone treatment is either auxins or gibberellins.
If the plant growth is stunted then I believe we are using abscisic acid, and if there is more branching we are using cytokinnins.
If ethylene is used then the leaves of the plant will probably abscise.
