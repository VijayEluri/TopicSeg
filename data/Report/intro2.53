For years it has been observed that plants will alter their growth patterns and development by responding to environmental cues.
These alterations, which are said to mainly be caused by hormones produced within the plant, are performed so as to increase the plant's survival rate, and often include prevention and promotion of stem elongation, color enhancement of fruits, and many others (Steane, 1).
However, what exactly are these 'plant hormones', and what exact role does each hormone play in the plant's development?
In general, there are five major hormones produced in plants.
These hormones include auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene, and according to the Lab Manual, each hormone serves a different purpose within the plant.
For example, auxins are defined as any chemical substance that promotes shoot elongation, cytokinins are defined as chemicals that both stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation, gibberellins are defined as chemicals that effect stem elongation and fruit growth, abscisic acids are defined as chemicals that inhibit the growth of buds and vascular cambium, and finally, ethylene is defined as a chemical that is a general growth inhibitor (Lab Manual, 2).
Based upon the Lab Manual's definitions of each hormone, and their roles in plants, I was eager to test my knowledge of the hormones, and the hormone's true effects on plant growth.
In order to carry out such a task, I performed an experiment in which I studied plant growth patterns in pea plants, based on two unknown plant hormones.
Additionally, I set up the experiment to test the effects of hormone concentration on plant growth so as to see if concentration of hormones does indeed effect growth.
The plant growth mechanisms that were measured and observed throughout the lab, so as to see the effects that the hormones had, included the total plant, the total number of internodes on the plant, and the internode lengths of the plant.
Moreover, two unknown hormone solutions were created and used so that I would be able to see their effects on the plants, and then make an educated guess as to the actual the hormones used.
(The reason for this method is so as to test my knowledge of the hormones and their effects.)
In this investigation I believe that the unknown hormones sprayed on yeah plant will effect the plant's growth either by stimulating or preventing growth.
I also believe the as the concentration of the hormones applied to the plants increases, the acuteness of plant growth will increase proportionally.
In the end, I propose that the data collected from the plant growth will support the notion that the hormones placed upon the plants will change the plant's growth in accordance with their predicted effects, and also that the severity in effects on the plant's growth will increase as the concentration of hormone applied to the plant increases.
