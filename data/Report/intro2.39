As environmental conditions vary, plants need plasticity in development to maximize reproductive success in all conditions.
This means that plants have the ability to adjust patterns of growth and maturity in order to evolve fruitfully.
The morphology and physiology necessary is gained through the appropriate balance between indeterminate growth and plant hormones.
Indeterminate growth is an important trait of plants in which growth limits are not predestined genetically.
(Burpee, et. al.
2004) This quality allows plants to grow continuously through the entirety of the plant life cycle, which can be as long as the amazing 4,767 year old Bristlecone Pine.
(Miller, 2004) This type of growth is necessary to overcome the disadvantage of being rooted to a certain location for the whole of a plants' existence.
Plant hormones are molecules that trigger a specific cellular reaction resulting in important internal signals and cues.
(Raven, et. al.
2002) These hormones are produced in one area of a plant and target tissues in other areas of the plant.
Many of the hormones are produced in various places and have multiple effects on plant development.
Almost all plant processes are guided by hormones, such as cell division, polarity of growth, seed germination, flowering, and differentiation of cells (Burpee, et. al. 2004).
One of the most important class of hormones identified are auxins.
Auxins are produced in the apical meristems, as well as other immature areas of the plant.
This hormone is known, among other things, to promote cell elongation in the shoots, inhibit cell elongation in the roots, and the formation of lateral roots.
(Takahasi, et. al, 1995) Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), the only known naturally occurring auxin, is used in elongation of stems.
(Burpee, et. al.
2004) Another phenomenon affected by auxin is apical dominance, which results in a "Christmas tree formation" by inhibiting the growth of lateral buds.
(Raven, et. al.
2002) The operation and mechanism of this hormone remains a mystery.
Yet, in a recent study, it has been shown that certain segments of mRNA have either decreased or increased as a result of the application of auxin.
(Sitbon, et. al.
1997) This fact gives scientists one clue regarding the means of action of this cell signaling device.
Along with other hormones, such as ethylene and cytokinin, auxin is an essential aspect of a plant's evolution and adaptation in coordination with its environment.
It is a vital aspect of the cooperation and interaction of plant hormones to produce the final, desired effect (Gaspar, et. al., 1996).
The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of hormones on plant growth and development, as well as determine the unknown treatment applied to the plants in the tests.
Measurements of number of internodes and internode length were recorded over the duration of the experiment.
The plants were tested after applications of a control treatment, unknown treatment 1 (in low and high concentrations), and unknown treatment 2 (in low and high concentrations).
It is hypothesized that a great increase in plant growth (internode length and number of internodes) would be caused by the application of the hormone auxin.
A decrease in shoot growth rate would be caused by the application of an inhibitor of auxin, by delaying and restricting its normal affects.
