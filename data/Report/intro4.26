Like their animal counterparts, plants are largely governed by hormone signaling.
Without these biological pathways, plants would be entirely ignorant of their environment, leading to detrimental effects.
Of the roles that hormones play, the most important are those that determine growth timing and structure.
This lab is designed to investigate plant hormones' effect on pea seedling growth.
Discussed below are a few plant hormones that are responsible for structure determination.
Auxin is likely one of the most versatile of plant hormones.
Besides playing an integral role in photo and gravitropism, auxin dictates apical dominance, which means that it promotes shoot elongation while inhibiting branching3.
Gibberellins likewise promote shoot growth.
Other responsibilities of this hormone include fruit growth and germination of seeds2.
Working opposite of these two hormones is abscisic acid.
Generally speaking, this compound induces dormancy, which protects a plant during harsh conditions.
In shoots, it inhibits growth1.
Like hormones in animals, plants are extremely responsive.
It is expected that topical application of hormone solution to the waterproofed cuticle will be sufficient to illustrate the hormones' effects.
The purpose of this experiment is to determine how two opposite-acting hormones will affect the growth of pea seedlings.
My hypothesis is that one hormone will promote plant growth and one hormone will inhibit it.
Comparisons will be performed against an untreated control.
