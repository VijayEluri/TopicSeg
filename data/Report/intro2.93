Plants are vital organisms that have shaped the world around us.
They are essential to the balance of nature and provide mankind with many resources.
Although stationary, plants have been successful throughout evolution by responding to their environment.
The term tropism describes the directional growth of a certain plant organ toward or away an external stimulus.
Plants are able to perform tropic responses by regulating different hormones which work to adapt them in a highly advantageous way.
The hormones involved in increasing growth are auxin and gibberellin.
Auxin is a key hormone in plant development and has many effects.
Processes such as autumnal loss of leaves and formation of buds, roots, flowers, and fruits all rely on auxin.
Its main role, however, involves the regulation of plant growth through controlled phases of cell division and elongation.
Auxin is able to increase the plasticity of the ridged cell wall and allow turgor pressure to expand the cell (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
The hormone is most abundantly produced in the meristems, but extends its effects on other parts of the plant by migrating through polarized transport and lateral diffusion (Sanchezbravo et al, 1991).
Gibberellin has similar effects in that it promotes cell division and elongation.
The percent of the hormone functioning in the plant is proportional to the lateral growth of its stem.
The major target of this effect occurs in the internode location (Biology Online, 2004).
Other development also depends on gibberellin.
It disturbs dormancy of seeds, induces flowering, and delays senescent of leaves.
The hormone is able to perform these functions by traveling through the plant by diffusion from its synthesis site which is the root and shoot apex (Hutchinson, 2004).
In this experiment, pea plants will be treated with high and low doses of unknown treatments.
The factors being analyzed are growth related; therefore, the treatments alter the production of a growth hormone.
One treatment will enhance the production of the particular hormone and the other will inhibit it.
The experiment will determine if altering the quantity of a growth hormone affects the growth rate of plants.
By comparing growth, this will be verified and the identity of the treatments will be revealed.
It is hypothesized that the data will show the treatments cause opposite growth effects on the plants.
The treatment that enhances the production of the growth hormone will cause the plants to grow larger.
The treatment that inhibits will lead to reduced growth.
It is also thought that the intensity of growth will correspond to the concentration of the treatment.
The high concentration of the inhibitor will cause less growth than the low.
The high concentration of the enhancer will cause greater growth than the low.
