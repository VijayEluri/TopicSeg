Like all living organisms plants sense and respond to their environment, but plants respond to their environment by altering their patterns of growth and development.
Plant hormones are internal signals known as small chemical messengers, which stimulate certain plant processes and inhibit others.
They are produced in small quantities and in a variety of areas in the plant.
The different hormones play important roles in the development of the plant, such as cell division, cell elongation, cell differentiation, seed germination, flowering and many other processes (Department of Biology, 2004).
There are five major classes of hormones including auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid.
Each has a variety of effects on plants, some growth promoting and some growth inhibiting.
Auxins are defined as any chemical substance that promotes elongation of the shoot, and Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) is the only natural known auxin (Department of Biology, 2004).
Auxin is produced in the apical meristem and moves down the shoot to enhance cell elongation.
It is also a part of the apical dominance feature in plants; in that it suppresses branch growth near the apex, but promotes growth farther down the shoot.
Interestingly enough, auxin has an opposite effect on the roots of the plant, it inhibits cell growth there.
Auxin is the only hormone that shows polarized transport, where it can actively transport from the tip to the base.
Cytokinins are generally found in actively growing tissues such as fruits and roots.
They are known for promoting cell division and differentiation in combination with auxin.
The ratio of cytokinin to auxin in a cell determines whether it will become a shoot or a root (Department of Biology, 2004).
Another plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is produced in the terminal buds, where it inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
When a plant is faced with adverse environmental conditions, such as drought, ABA helps the plant cope and promotes dormancy.
During periods of water stress, ABA promotes closure of the stomata resulting in water conservation for the plant (Department of Biology, 2004).
A chief member of the plant hormones is gibberellins, which effects stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
One of gibberellins most prominent factors is stimulation of cell division and elongation.
A plant that contains high doses of gibberellin will grow tall and spindly, a characteristic known as bolting.
But if the plant has low amounts of gibberellin, it will cause dwarfism (Department of Biology, 2004).
The most unique plant hormone has to be ethylene.
Unlike any of the other hormones, it is a gaseous compound that diffuses through the spaces between cells.
It is a growth inhibitor, and is important in the aging process, predominantly in the abscission of leaves (leaves falling off in the fall).
This particularly experiment will investigate two "unknown" hormones, that will have effects on the growth of maturing pea plants.
It is predicted that one of the treatments is one of the hormones mentioned, which will increase the growth of the plant, while the other treatment is an inhibiting.
The purpose of this experiment is to observe the effects of the two unknown treatments and to determine which treatment is the inhibitor and which is the hormone that promotes growth.
It is suspected that the results of the treatments will give clear differences between the two, showing one that prevents growth and the other that promotes it.
