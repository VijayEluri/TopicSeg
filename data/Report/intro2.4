There are five general classes of hormones including auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, ethylene, and abscisic acid.
Each has a variety of effects on plants, some promoting growth and some inhibiting it.
Many are transported through the vascular system of the plant, and others are gaseous and simply diffuse within and between plants.
Auxin is known to promote shoot growth by stimulating elongation in stem cells.
Because auxin is produced in the apical meristem of the plant, it is a component of the apical dominance characteristic that is seen in plants.
Auxin inhibits branch growth near the apex, but promotes closer to the base of the plant, hence, the 'Christmas tree shape' of many plants (Gilroy, 2004).
Cytokinins are generally found in actively growing tissues such as fruits and roots.
They are known for promoting cell division and differentiation in combination with auxin (Department of Biology, 2004).
Contrasting with auxin, cytokinins stimulate the growth of lateral branches in shoots (Raven and Johnson, 1995).
Gibberellins promote stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination (Department of Biology, 2004).
Gibberellins in high concentrations can contribute to bolting, when plants growth very tall and spindly quickly and flower early, and their absence can is known to cause dwarfism in plants.
The role of ethylene in plants is an important contribution to the abscission of leaves in the fall season.
Ethylene acts as a growth inhibitor, and is known to promote fruit ripening, as well as the loss of leaves and fruit at the end of the growing season (Department of Biology, 2004).
Helping plants adapt to adverse environmental conditions is the task of the hormone abscisic acid in plants.
Abscisic acid promotes dormancy and plant aging, and can help to control the amount of water in primarily mature leaves by regulating opening and closing the stomata (Raven and Johnson, 1995).
This experiment will examine the effects of two "unknown" hormones on pea plant growth.
It is expected that one treatment will be one of the plant hormones mentioned, and the other will inhibit the presence of that hormone in the plant.
The purpose of the lab will be to monitor the effects of the unknown treatment and attempt to determine the hormone/hormone inhibitor identity.
It was suspected that the data will support that one hormone may promote growth and the other may prevent growth or promote aging, and that there will be a clear difference in the response of the plants on different treatments.
