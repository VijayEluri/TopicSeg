Plant growth is often directed by environmental factors.
Tropisms are the growth responses to external stimuli (Raven).
Phototropism promotes growth toward a light source.
This allows for a plant to maximize the use of available light.
Plants exhibit indeterminate growth where growth is not predetermined through genetics due to the existence of meristems, or the active tissues producing new cells (Raven).
This allows for the ability to modify growth with hormones.
The hormone Auxin promotes stem elongation and growth, inhibits lateral growth and promotes cellular division (Raven).
Growth is encouraged by increased cell wall plasticity.
Low concentrations of auxin best promote cell wall plasticity, so high levels of this hormone must be broken down quickly to prevent accumulation (Raven).
Auxin is involved in most phototropic responses (Raven).
Plant morphology can easily be measured.
Nodes are the site of leaf attachment.
The space between nodes is called an internode.
Counting and measuring these morphologies allows one to determine growth patterns over time.
Pea seedlings will tropically respond to two different plant hormones and a significant difference between treatments over one week will be observed.
