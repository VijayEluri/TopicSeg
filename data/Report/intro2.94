Like all living organisms, plants sense and respond to their environment.
Plants respond to environmental cues by altering their patterns of growth and development.
Plants have the property of indeterminate growth; that is, they can continue to grow and differentiate throughout their lives, and the program for development remains somewhat plastic.
Plasticity allows a plant to adjust growth patterns to maximize reproductive success for a given set of environmental conditions.
A plant's morphology and physiology are tuned to their surroundings by an interaction of environmental cues and internal signals.
Among the most important internal signals are small chemical messengers known as plant hormones.
Similar to animal hormones, plant hormones are produced in small quantities in one part of the plant, and are transported to other areas where they exert their effects.
Each hormone has a multiplicity of effects, depending upon the site of action, developmental stage of the plant, and concentration of the hormone.
There are five major classes of hormones, which are the auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are defined as any chemical substance that promotes elongation of coleoptiles.
The naturally occurring auxin, Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), gives a phenomenon known as apical dominance, which suppress the growth of lateral buds resulting in a rise to lateral shoots.
Cytokinins are a group of plant hormones that both stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
They are produced in actively growing tissues, particularly developing embryos, fruits, and roots.
Cytokinins, synthesized in the roots, move to their targets in the aerial part of the plant by way of the xylem sap.
The cytokinin/auxin balance also is important for control of apical dominance.
While auxin suppresses lateral bud growth, cytokine stimulates it.
Thus, there is more lateral bud growth closer to roots where the cytokinin levels are higher than the auxin levels.
The gibberellins (GA3) are a large class of naturally occurring plant hormones.
They have a variety of effects on plant growth including stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Acting in concert with auxin, the most conspicuous effect of gibberellins is the stimulation of cell division and elongation in stems.
High doses of gibberellin cause plants to grow very tall and spindly, a phenomenon referred to as bolting.
The fourth class of plant hormones, abscisic acid (ABA), is produced in the terminal buds.
This hormone inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
In so doing, ABA promotes dormancy, and hence, can help a plant cope with adverse environmental conditions, such as drought.
During periods of water stress, ABA promotes closure of the stomata resulting in water conservation for the plant.
Finally, ethylene is a simple gaseous compound that diffuses through the air spaces between plant cells.
Ethylene acts as a growth inhibitor.
As such, it has important functions in the aging process, particularly the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
Auxins counteract these aging effects and prolong the length of time that these structures stay on the plant.
The purpose of this experiment was to design and setup an experiment with pea seedlings to investigate the effects of unknown compounds on plant growth, and then identify the unknown compounds.
Comparing the treatments on the plants and their influence on the growth of the seedlings will identify the hormones used.
The general questions that are addressed in this lab are does higher or lesser concentrations of hormones on the seedlings inhibit or promote plant growth as well as what hormones affected the growth either positively or negatively, of the plant.
Possible outcomes of the experiment are that either the hormones used, such as auxins, cytokinins, or gibberellins could have been used to promote the growth of the plants and hormones such as abscisic acid and ethylene may have also been used to inhibit the growth of the seedlings.
Furthermore, inhibitors of the hormones could have also been used to alter the growth of the plants.
Also, it can be hypothesized that higher concentrations of growth promoters will continue to promote continual growth.
A prediction cannot be made yet as to what hormones were used in this experiment, the data must be analyzed first to make a guess.
