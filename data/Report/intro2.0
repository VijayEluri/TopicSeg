In order for any organism, plant or animal, to survive in their environment growth is essential.
Growing for plants is especially important because they respond to their surroundings and will shape their own development around their environment.
Plants show indeterminate growth, meaning that they have no predetermined height or size (Raven, 2002, p. 754).
In order for plants to grow, many factors will play a role.
Some examples of these factors include sunlight, which helps promote photosynthesis, and water, which helps to hydrate the plant.
In addition to these, there are also plant hormones which may cause plants to grow in every direction and may determine what part of the plant shows growth.
There are five main plant hormones; auxin, cytokinin, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Each one has a specific function.
Auxin is responsible for growth in the shoots and inhibition of growth in the roots (Raven, 2002, p. 815).
Cytokinins are accountable for cell replication, inhibition of lateral roots and when in conjunction with auxin help determine the shape of the plant (Raven, 2002, p.819).
Gibberellins help to slow seed germination, and when combined with auxin can elongate stems (Raven, 2002, p. 820).
Ethylene allows for development of fruits, and the abscission of leaves and fruits (Raven, 2002, p. 822).
Unfortunately, very little is known regarding abscisic acid's functions.
The variables in this lab were the four plants that had been sprayed with treatments.
These treatments were unknown plant hormones.
Two plants had been treated with either Treatment 1 or Treatment 2 at high concentrations.
The other two plants were treated with either Treatment 1 or Treatment 2 at low concentrations.
The remaining two plants were not treated, and were sprayed only with water; these two plants provided controls for the experiment.
The purpose of this lab was to understand how the treatments and the concentrations of the treatments used would effect plant growth.
Through the data collected from this lab we are able to predict that the treatments, in both high and low concentrations, used had an influence on plant growth in one way or another; whether it inhibited or promoted plant development.
The data used to prove my hypothesis, was done by spraying each plant with a treatment at both concentrations of high and low (my group did treatment 1).
After testing the treated plants after 1 week, we compared our results to the control plants.
