Most plants, including pea plants, show the quality of indeterminate growth.
This means that the plant can continue to grow and differentiate throughout their lives (Burpee, 2004).
However, certain plant hormones can have an effect on the plant's development in areas including cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination, flowering and senescence (2004).
Additionally, plants respond to external stimuli called tropisms, the main three being a response to light, gravity, and touch.
These are known respectively as phototropism, gravitropism, and thigmotropism.
Through the procedure of this experiment, the effects of plant hormones on pea plants will be examined.
In particular, the number of internodes, length of internodes, and total height will be found and measured by comparing controlled plants to plants treated with either high or low levels of the unknown hormone compound.
This will achieve the purpose of the experiment, which is to determine the difference in growth and to identify the unknown compound.
This data will show that the compounds used will be identifiable after observing the differences in average growth in each category.
