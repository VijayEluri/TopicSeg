Plants are able to adjust their growth patterns according to their surrounding environment.
They exhibit indeterminate growth which allows them to continue to grow and differentiate all throughout their life.
Part of this plasticity that plants exhibit is due to different hormones circulating internally in plants (Lab Manual, 2004).
Plant hormones, also referred to as growth factors, are produced in different areas throughout the plant and travel to the appropriate tissues controlling many different processes within the cell.
There are five types of plant hormones: abscisic acid, cytokinins, ethylene, auxin, and gibberellins (Lab Manual, 2004).
Abscisic acid is mainly responsible for the closure of stomata to control water loss, to induce seeds to synthesize proteins for storage, to defend against pathogens, and can at times also inhibit shoot growth.
In inhibiting this growth, it is an effective way to produce dormancy in the cell in response to harsh environmental situations and stress (Hine and Martin, 2000).
Cytokinins stimulate cell division and lateral bud formation synthesized in the roots.
This helps explain why more lateral branching is found closer to the roots.
In some cases, cytokinins promote leaf expansion.
When coupled with auxin, it regulates the plant growth pattern (Plant Hormones).
Ethylene is a unique hormone to plants because it is a gaseous compound that diffuses throughout the plant cells.
Ethylene stimulates the release of dormancy, therefore contributing to fruit ripening (senescence) and also is responsible for leaves falling in the autumn, the process known as leaf abscission.
Ethylene also promotes flower opening and in some cases may play a role in root formation (Plant Hormones.)
Auxin is a chemical substance that while making many processes in plants occur, mainly functions to promote elongation of the shoot.
It stimulates differentiation both in the phloem and xylem and often delays leaf senescence.
Auxin is found naturally as indoleacetic acid (IAA) but can also be made in many forms synthetically.
After being produced in the apical meristem, it then travels down the shoot to stimulate cell growth by elongation (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
This auxin in the apical bud suppresses the growth of lateral buds in the plant, thereby being responsible for apical dominance.
Additionally, at high concentrations, auxin can actually stimulate the production of ethylene (Hine and Martin, 2000).
Gibberellins also promote expansion and elongation of stem tissue and are produced in the apical regions of shoots and roots.
The effect of gibberellins is enhanced by the presence of auxin (Raven and Johnson, 2002) While there are many different classes of gibberellins, they have many different functions other than just elongation, such as causing bolting, the term used when plants grow tall and spindly.
If only an extremely small amount of gibberellins exists, dwarfism can result.
Gibberellins also function to induce maleness in dioecious flowers.
Among other effects, they can play a role in breaking seed dormancy for plans that require light for germination and play a part in seedless fruit development (Plant Hormones).
In this lab, plant growth was the major variable considered.
Plant height was observed before and after one week of treating with an unknown hormone and the experiment was set up to examine the hormone's effects.
As height was the major factor observed, the hormones that must be considered the most are auxin and gibberellins.
If plants showed an increase in shoot growth with the treatment, the unknown compound was one that induced growth, while if there was little or no growth, the treatment most likely inhibited growth by tampering with the effectiveness of the hormone.
The two treatments of the unknown substance, both in high and low doses, were applied to pea plants and one set of pea plants was left as a control.
Depending on whether plants grew or not, the treatment could be classified as stimulating or inhibiting hormone action, respectively.
The data will show how the plants responded to the treatments in order to decipher what the substance was.
