Plants are the primary producers and are fundamental to life on earth.
Ensuring plants health and growth is essential to maintaining a successful environment.
Plants sense and respond to the environment just like any other organism and they demonstrate indeterminate growth.
Indeterminate growth is growth that has no genetically defined limits; it explains why plants can endlessly grow while remaining plastic.
Being plastic allows plants to be adjustable in their growth as they are affected by changing environments.
Plant hormones are an important internal signal that regulates growth and development in plants.
Hormones along with interaction of environmental cues allow a plant to successfully continue morphology and physiology.
Plant hormones are produced and are very effective in low concentrations.
They are usually produced in one part of a plant and carried to other areas where they demonstrate their effectiveness.
Individual hormones can have more than one affect and can be placed on a variety of different tissues.
The effects of hormones can vary depending on its specific function.
Some promote cell division and others can accelerate fruit ripening (Lab Manual 1).
Auxin, Cytokinins, Gibberellins, Abscisic Acid, and Ethylene are among the most predominate hormones.
Auxin stimulates expansion growth, stimulates ethylene production and is believed to be responsible for apical dominance.
Apical dominance is an inhibitory influence upon lateral (auxiliary) bud development.
Cytokinins promote lateral bud development and generally (but not always) slow down elongation growth of root or stem sections.
Gibberellins work alongside auxin to stimulate cell division and elongation in stems.
Plants exposed to high doses of this hormone grow very tall and spindly; this is referred to as bolting.
Abscisic Acid is the regulator of stomatal aperture and hence transpiration and is referred to the hormone dealing with water.
It also inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
Ethylene is a gas hormone therefore it never requires transpiration; it diffuses.
Ethylene accelerates fruit ripening and is used in grocery stores to ripen produce prior to placing it on display (Purdue Horticulture 16 April 2004).
In this lab unknown compounds were sprayed on pea plants.
The purpose of this lab was to design and setup an experiment with pea seedlings to investigate the effects of unknown compounds on plant growth, and then identify the unknown compounds.
Some people may question how much of a visual effect hormones can have on a plant.
Others may wonder how we would determine each individual hormone, for it was initially unknown to us.
Some group members wondered if there would be enough data to form conclusions.
Others wondered if concentration would have a major role in the effect of hormones.
The data from this lab will show varied results for the different plants.
Different concentrations will offer different changes in growth, while plants sprayed with water should not show any real change in growth.
I expect the two different treatments to produce opposite effects on the plants.
Opposite effects would produce a variance in the data for easy comparisons and unknown compounds could be identified.
