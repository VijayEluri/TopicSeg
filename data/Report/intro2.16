Plant hormones are chemicals which play a role in physiological processes, including flowering, rooting, and plant growth (Arteca, 2004).
These hormones can be divided into five major classes: auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins, and ethylene (Burpee, 2004).
According to Introduction to Horticulture, 3rd Edition, auxin promotes cell division and cell elongation, and is important in processes such as phototropism and root formation.
Cytokinins promote cell division and lateral bud growth (Burpee, 2004).
Abscisic acid inhibits growth and helps to promote dormancy which helps plants cope with stressful conditions.
Gibberellins produces stem elongation through cell elongation and division, producing "bolting" if present in high doses.
Ethylene is a gaseous hormone, which inhibits growth.
It is important in fruit ripening as well as senescence of leaves and flowers (Burpee, 2004).
Plant hormones are used today in both the agricultural and horticultural industries (Shroeder, 2000).
Further study of the effects of hormones may provide beneficial information regarding how much is currently used vs. how much is needed to achieve the desired effects.
The purpose of this experiment is to look at plant growth in response to solutions of unknown compounds.
The plants receiving treatments are expected to exhibit different percent changes in plant height, number of internodes, and average internode length in comparison to the control plants.
These differences will indicate whether the solution is a plant growth promoter or inhibitor.
Students will then be able to determine what compounds are present in the solutions.
For example, if a plant experiences rapid growth in response to a solution, especially in high concentrations, it may be concluded that it was treated with a solution containing Gibberellins.
