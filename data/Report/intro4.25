Unlike most other multicellular organisms, plants lack the ability to move in response to their environment.
To counter this disadvantage, plants have adapted a number of mechanisms to respond to their environment.
Plants have demonstrated the ability to react to light, gravity, and even touch through the manipulation of internal chemical signals, a significant portion of which are hormones (Burpee, 2004).
There are five major classes of hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Each hormone can serve several different functions by affecting different tissues in different ways.
In a study of the affects of auxin manipulation on healthy tissues and Crown-gall tumor tissues, auxin was found to dramatically increase growth in healthy sunflower stems while proving completely inhibitory in tumor tissues at high concentrations (de Ropp, 1947).
In general, auxins cause elongation of shoots, cytokinin stimulates lateral shoot growth, gibberellins cause stem elongation, abscisic acid promotes dormancy, and ethylene inhibits growth (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
In this experiment two unknown treatments will be administered to pea plant seedlings.
Pea plants have been chosen for this experiment as they grow quickly, are easy to care for, and are inexpensive.
Plant height, the number of internodes, and internode length will all be measured in order to determine whether a hormone or a hormone inhibitor was used.
To control for the spraying of solution, control plants were used that were sprayed with water when the other plants were sprayed with one of two treatments at two different concentrations.
Plants exhibiting rapid growth and a large increase in internode length could possibly have been exposed to a growth stimulating hormone such as auxin, which causes shoot elongation.
If, for one of the treatments the plants exhibit a decrease in average internode length and an increase in plant height that is less than that of the control it is possible that the plant was treated with a hormone inhibitor.
As low concentrations of hormones typically have a greater effect than high concentrations it is expected that the plants exposed to low concentrations will exhibit more notable differences in growth than plants under the same treatment at higher concentrations.
