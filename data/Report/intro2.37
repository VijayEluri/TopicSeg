Anchored to the ground and unable to directly move cells around for growth, plants have adapted in order to respond to their environment and to grow.
Plants exhibit indeterminate growth, meaning they do not have a predetermined size, and will continue to grow and differentiate endlessly throughout their lifespan.
Meristems house embryonic tissue and are sites where dividing cells differentiate into tissues.
Apical meristems are where cell division occurs at the tips of roots and shoots.
The process by which branching is suppressed while vertical height increases is known as apical dominance.
Nodes are the regions in stems from which leaves develop, and internodes are the spaces which separate nodes.
Plant hormones are synthesized in various locations throughout the plant and effect cell division, the direction of plant growth, elongation, germination, ripening and water status, among other plant characteristics.
The hormones' effects depend on their location, concentration, and the stage of development of the plant.
Five of the major classes of hormones include: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins, located in the apical meristems, inhibit elongation in roots and branching in shoots, and stimulate elongation in shoots and branching in roots.
Cytokinins, mainly produced in root apical meristems, stimulate cell division and control cell differentiation.
In balance with auxin, cytokinins will suppress the effects of auxin, while auxin suppresses the effects of cytokinin.
Gibberellins influence stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
In concert with auxins, high gibberellin concentrations increases stem growth.
Abscisic acid (ABA) suppresses growth and elongation of buds, promotes senescence, and closes stomata.
Lastly, ethylene, a gas, promotes aging, fruit ripening, and leaf abscission.
 The purpose of this lab is to study the effects that hormones have on plant growth.  By examining the changes in pea plant height, and internode number and length between week one and two, and comparing the data of the control plants to those of the treated plants, the unknown treatments sprayed on the plants can be identified.  Thus, each group will study if the treatments inhibit or stimulate growth.  If the hormone is auxin, then the stems will most likely grow and branching will be inhibited, thus the number of nodes will decrease.  Gibberellins will also cause the plants to grow more.  Cytokinins will inhibit stem growth.  Ethylene will probably cause the leaves to fall off, and ABA might cause the plants to swell drastically since the stomata will close and the plant will withhold water. ==========
