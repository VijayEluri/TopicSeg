Scientists have been theorizing since Charles and Francis Darwin's Power of Movement in Plants about the existence and role of plant hormones and morphogens.
In the past 30 years a solid model for the biochemical workings of hormonal action and movement in plants has been established (Jones 1998).
Currently the most important known hormones and morphogens (compounds that are distributed unevenly along a spatial gradient) are auxins (e.g. indoleacetic acids), gibberellins (e.g. gibberellic acid), ethylene, cytokinins, and abscisic acid.
In this experiment, two unknown compounds drawn from this list were applied once exogenously to pea seedlings, and the plants' total height, number of internodes, and average internode lengths were recorded before treatment and again a week after treatment.
A control group of pea seedlings was grown without exogenous chemical treatment.
The purpose of the experiment was to attempt to correctly determine from growth data and knowledge of the supposed effects of these compounds the identity of the hormonal treatments used.
These data should show that those plants exhibiting increased height and average internode length were treated with auxin or cytokinin, while those exhibiting increased number of internodes in addition to these phenotypic developments were most likely treated with a gibberellin.
Those plants exhibiting stunted growth were likely treated with ethylene, and those exhibiting leaf abscission were probably treated with abscisic acid.
