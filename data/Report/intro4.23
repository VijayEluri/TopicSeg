Plant hormones are substances that affect cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination, flowering and senescence.
There are five major classes of plant hormones; auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Each hormone has a different effect on the plants, and many times work with other hormones to achieve the effect.
The auxins are any chemical substance that promotes shoot growth.
This growth simultaneously suppresses the growth of lateral buds, which leads to apical dominance.
The cytokinins stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
They usually work with auxins and other hormones to regulate growth patterns.
The cytokinin/auxin balance is important for the control of apical dominance.
While auxin suprepresses lateral bud growth, cytokinin stimulates it (Cyr 2).
The gibberellins effect stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination.
High doses of gibberellin cause plant bolting, where as low doses cause dwarfism.
Abscisic acid is produced in the terminal buds and inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
Abscisic acid can also promote dormancy, and help a plant cope with adverse environmental conditions (Cyr 2).
Ethylene acts as a growth inhibitor, and also has important functions in the aging process.
As a plant ages the auxin levels naturally decrease in the leaves and fruit while the ethylene levels increase (Cyr 2).
In this lab plants were sprayed with two unknown hormones for one week.
We compared the growth or lack there of to the control group for each treatment.
The purpose was to try and decide which two hormones were used on the plants.
I believe that one of the treatments will be a growth inhibitor and one will be a growth promoter.
By measuring the total height, the number of internodes and the length of the internodes we were able to determine which two hormones were used on the plants.
