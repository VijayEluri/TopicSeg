To have a better appreciation of plants, it is important to have some understanding of how plants grow.
Growth of plants, like that of animals, is dependent on hormones.
Auxin is probably the most important hormone in plants.
It plays a big role in the promotion of shoot growth as well as apical dominance.
Apical dominance, also known as the Christmas tree effect, is when braches grow longer at the lower part of a plant and shorter at the upper portion, so as to stabilize the plant.4 Cytokinins, Gibberellins, Abscisic Acid, and Ethylene are among other hormones that help to establish growth patterns in plants.
Cytokinins mostly work with Auxin to stimulate lateral growth.
Gibberellins are mostly known for their connection to plant bolting.
Bolting is when plants shoot up very tall and spindly.
This is caused by a large amount of Gibberellin.
Abscisic acid serves as a way of protecting plants in unfriendly environmental conditions, by causing the plant to remain dormant.
Ethylene is mostly known for stimulating plant ripening.4
Another important aspect of plant growth is the fact that plants grow indeterminately.
This means that while humans and other animals grow to a specific (determinant) height, plants will continue to grow with age.
Plants, using the aforementioned hormones, grow at meristems.
These are locations on a plant that contain embryonic tissue and thus where new growth occurs.4 The apical meristem specifically is the region at the very top of the plant.
Plants also elongate at internodes which are the area between nodes (See Figure 1).

Plants also exhibit plasticity, meaning they adapt easily to their environments.
These adaptations are known as tropisms.
Phototropism is the movement of plants towards light.
Gravitropism is the upward growth of plants despite the condition to which they are coming out of the ground.
Thigmotropism is the growth in response to touch.
These tropisms are further explained in the experiment on the last page of this lab.
The purpose of this experiment is to determine what treatments each of six plants are given based on their growth and the knowledge about plant growth and plant hormones.
The questions that need to be considered are: How does a large dose of either of the two unknown treatments affect the plant?
How does a small dose?
Which hormones are the unknown treatments?
It is hypothesized that hormones such Auxin will cause the plant to grow more than the control and inhibitory hormones such as Abscisic Acid will cause the plant to grow at a slower rate than the control.
