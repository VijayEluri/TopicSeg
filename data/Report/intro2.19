Like all organisms, plants sense and respond to their environment.
A plant's morphology and physiology are tuned to their surroundings by an interaction of environmental cues and internal signals (Raven and Johnson 2002).
Plant hormones are chemical messengers that are among the most important internal signals.
Five major classes of hormones are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene (see table 41. 1 in Raven and Johnson 2002).
Auxins are hormones that promote stem elongation, inhibit leaf abscission, promote cell division, induce ethylene production, and promote lateral bud dormancy thus resulting in the phenomenon known as apical dominance.
Cytokinins are chemically related to the nucleotide adenine and are synthesized in the roots and move by way of the xylem sap.
They stimulate cell division only in the presence of auxin, promote chloroplast development, delay leaf aging, and promote bud formation.
Therefore, the cytokinin/auxin balance determines whether a cell will differentiate into a shoot or a root.
Gibberellins promote stem elongation and stimulate germination of seeds.
High doses of this hormone causes a phenomenon know as bolting.
Abscisic acid is a hormone that is produced in the lateral buds and is greatly affected by water.
It inhibits bud growth, controls stomata closure, controls seed dormancy, and inhibits other hormones.
Ethylene is a gaseous compound that diffuses through the air spaces between plant cells.
It is responsible for the control in leaf, flower, and fruit abscission and the promotion of fruit ripening.
All of these plant hormones act in concert to "balance" the growth of the plant.
The main purpose of this lab was to investigate the effects of unknown hormones on pea plant growth and then identify what the unknown plant hormones were.
With these objectives in mind, the questions asked were: What is the hormone in treatment 1 or was it an inhibitor and what is the hormone in treatment 2 or what is an inhibitor?
In order to come to a conclusion, a quantitative analysis of the results was completed by computing % change in growth, number of internodes, and internode length.
It was hypothesized that the data would show that treatment 1 involved the plant hormone auxin because shoot growth increased dramatically while treatment 2 was a growth inhibitor due to the fact that shoot growth was less than that of the control plant.
