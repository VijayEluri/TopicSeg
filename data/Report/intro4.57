All living organisms sense and respond to their surrounding environment.
However, the mechanisms used by plants and animals greatly differ.
Animals, as ourselves, are able to move around where we please.
If it is too hot outside we are free to find shade under a tree, go into an air conditioned building, or jump into a swimming pool.
Plants, on the other hand, are much different than animals when it comes to environmental response.
Plants are rooted in a specific location and have no choice but to stay in that spot for most of their lives.
Plants, therefore, have developed special properties which allow them to face the sometimes harsh effects of their surroundings.
Most plants have an amazing property called indeterminate growth, which is the ability to grow and differentiate throughout their lives, and the course for their development remains somewhat plastic (Leicht).
Tropisms, positive or negative growth responses to external stimuli, often move plants to respond to their environment.
External stimuli are responded to through internal signals.
These internal signals are plant hormones, small chemical messengers.
Plant hormones, produced in numerous places within the plant, each have a variety of effects including cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, branching pattern, flowering and senescence (Leicht).
Five major classes of plant hormones are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are any substance that promotes shoot elongation and the only known natural auxin is indole 3-acetic acid (IAA).
IAA is made in the apical meristem of shoots and moves to where cell elongation takes place.
This also suppresses growth of lateral buds leading to what is known as apical dominance.
Another group of hormones, cytokinins, stimulate cell division and differentiation in plants when in combination with auxin (Biology).
Cytokinins are made in the roots and move to their targets in the shoot of the plant where they stimulate lateral bud growth (Leicht).
Gibberellins, or gibberellic acid, are a large class of plant hormones that affect a plant by way of stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination (Leicht).
They are produced in the apical parts of both shoots and roots and act together with auxin and other hormones (Biology).
Another class of plant hormones is abscisic acid and is produced in the terminal buds.
Abscisic acid helps a plant deal with unfavorable environmental conditions by inhibiting growth of buds and vascular cambium and closes stomata pores in order to conserve water (Leicht).
Finally, ethylene is a simple gaseous compound that acts as a growth inhibitor.
Ethylene stimulates ripening in fruit and plays an important part in the abscission of leaves, flowers and fruits (Leicht).
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of unknown compounds on a plant's growth, and then identify the compounds.
There are generally two types of groups that can be taken into the identification process.
These two groups are growth promoters including auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins and growth inhibitors including abscisic acid and ethylene.
The data collected can be analyzed to determine the identity of both hormones used in the experiment.
