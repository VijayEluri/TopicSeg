While developing and growing in nature, plants must adjust to their surroundings to survive.
Unlike most organisms, they exhibit indeterminate growth, which means that they are able to grow without any defined limit.
As a result of this, plants can change their growth to adapt to the different environmental cues(Burpee, 2004).
For instance, a plant could accelerate its growth in the vertical direction so as to come in contact with the sunlight.
Because plants are able to conform to their environment, they are said to exhibit plasticity.
To accomplish this feat of plasticity, plants must first sense their environment and then use internal mechanisms to bring about changes.
Like animals, plants have complex internal signaling mechanisms and hormones are what accomplish much of the signaling, for plants lack nervous systems.
Hormones are chemical substances that are produced in certain areas and then transported throughout the plant to bring about a physiological change.
This transportation occurs within xylem and phloem, through diffusion, or by polarized transport.
Instead of being produced in an area of specialized tissue, hormones are produced within tissue that is also carrying out other processes to maintain the plant.
The exact function of a plant hormone can be variable for different regions respond differently to the same hormone.
Plant hormones have the ability to bring about numerous responses(Raven, 812-823).
An example of a hormone causing two different responses would be auxin which inhibits branching in the stems of plants but promotes branching in the root system.
As of today, there are five major classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid.
Auxin, which is produced in the apical meristem, is responsible for the elongation of cells in the shoot but inhibits elongation in the roots.
As stated previously, it also influences the branching patterns of the roots and shoots.
Cytokinins are synthesized in the roots and can be found working with other hormones such as auxin to regulate growth patterns.
It is able to control apical dominance and keep things in balance.
Gibberellins are characterized by the ability to promote stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination.
The next class is abscisic acid, and its major function is to allow the plant to adjust to drought and water stress.
The last class is ethylene, which is a gas, and it is important in causing the abscission of leaves, fruits and flowers(Burpee, 2004).
These are only a few of the functions which are carried out by each hormone, for as stated before, a hormone can take on a variety of roles.
As one can see, plant hormones have a vital role in maintaining the life of the plant.
By observing the physical response of a plant to a certain environmental factor, one should be able to identify the hormone which is causing the response.
The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of two unknown compounds, which were applied at a high and low concentration and then determine their identity.
Since the functions of the hormones are known, the prediction was made that the physical changes in the plant should be enough to identify the compounds.
