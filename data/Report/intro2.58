Plants play a large role in life on earth.
They are responsible for the presence of oxygen in our atmosphere which is the fuel of life.
Like all living organisms plants perform many of the same functions such as reproduce, and monitor as well as respond to the environment.
The only difference is that plants complete these tasks with out the nervous system, muscles and the immune system.
They respond to changes in the environment by altering their patterns of growth and development.
What gives them the ability to do this is that plants exhibit indeterminate growth.
Plants can continuously grow and differentiate for they have no genetically predetermined limit.
Environmental cues and internal signals interact to determine the morphology of a plant (Lab Manual - 2004).
An internal signal is a chemical messenger that is produced in one area of the plant and transported to another area where it has an effect ("Phytohormones").
These messengers are otherwise known as hormones.
In plants, there are five major classes of hormones all having a different effect on plant growth.
Auxin (IAA), Cytokinins, Gibberellins (GA3), Abscisic Acid (ABA) and Ethylene are among these five (Lab Manual - 2004).
Auxins are chemical substances that promote shoot elongation.
Auxin plays a role in inhibiting cell elongation in roots but promoting branching in roots.
This hormone is responsible for apical dominance, a process in which lateral buds and branching are suppressed in the shoot.
It is also responsible for growth toward a light source.
Auxin is synthesized in the apical meristem of shoots and is moved through the plant via polar transport.
Cytokinins are another plant hormone that stimulates cell division and organogenesis.
Organogenesis is a plants "deal with it syndrome" in which it generates new plant parts when something happens to the original ones.
Cytokinins are synthesized in roots and move up through the plants via the xylem and phloem.
Gibberellins are a type of hormone that is synthesized in germinating embryos, developing leaves and in the root and shoot apex.
Gibberellin is responsible for internode elongation, seed germination and flower development.
It does this by stimulating cell division in the shoots causing bolting, the process in which plants grow very tall.
Another type of hormone is Ethylene which is synthesized everywhere in a plant and because it is a gas, it diffuses between air spaces in plant cells.
It acts as a growth inhibitor of buds and flowers.
Ethylene plays a large role in leaf fall otherwise known as abscission as well as the aging process of plants (senescence).
The fifth type of hormone is Abscisic Acid which is produced in the terminal buds.
It inhibits growth of buds in the vascular cambium and also plays a large role in water status of a plant.
Within this lab, there are independent and dependent variables.
The independent variable in this lab is the treatment applied to the plants and the dependent variable is the growth that the plant exhibits.
The main objective of this lab is to determine the effect of two different types of hormones on plant growth, whether they inhibited growth or stimulated it.
The goal is to also try to identify the unknown compounds that were applied to the pea seedlings.
It is predicted that if there is a greater percent change, the treatment was a stimulator and if the growth was slowed the treatment was an inhibitor.
It is also predicted that if the hormone is a stimulator such as auxin or gibberellin, at a high concentration, the plant's internode length as well as height will grow more; hence a greater percent change.
This is the opposite for a hormone that is an inhibitor.
