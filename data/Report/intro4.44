Plants are able to respond to their environments in many ways.
Unlike animals, which can respond to their environment by motion, plants must alter their patterns of growth and development (lab manual).
Plants are able to use hormones to cause many different affects in the plant.
Processes such as cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination flowering and senescence are all affected by plant hormones (lab manual).
There are five major types of plant hormones; auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene (lab manual).
These plant hormones all affect the plant in different ways but many of them work together.
Auxins are defined as any chemical substance that promotes elongation of coleoptiles.
Cytokinins both stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation (lab manual).
Cytokinins and auxins work together in a plant.
Auxins and cytokinins work together to regulate apical dominance.
Gibberellins have many effects on plants such as stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination (lab manual).
Abscisic acid inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
The last plant hormone is Ethylene.
Initially it was thought that Ethylene only had a role in fruit ripening however it is now known that ethylene has many other roles in the development of the plant.
These include release of dormancy, flower ripening and flower and leaf senescence (Arshad).
In this experiment our groups used unknown compounds on pea seedlings to try and determine what the unknown compound was and what its effect on the growth of the pea seedlings was.
I hypothesize that the pea seedlings that show the biggest increase in total plant height and in the total number of internodes will have been sprayed with a solution containing auxin.
I think this because auxin is responsible for elongation of the coleoptile.
I also hypothesize that if any of the plants that were sprayed with a high dose of the solution exhibit tall and spindly growth, then it is most likely that the solution contained gibberellins.
If too much of the hormone gibberellins is applied, plants exhibit "bolting" (lab manual).
For the plants that show hardly any increase in stem length, I hypothesize that an extremely low dose of gibberellins could have been used because this is thought to cause dwarfism in plants (lab manual).
I also hypothesize that an auxin inhibitor could have been used since this would inhibit the elongation of the coleoptile.
