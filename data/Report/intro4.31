Unlike animals which follow a set growing pattern determined by their genes, plants grow in reaction to their environment.
This growth is controlled by hormones released by the plant in response to various environmental triggers.
A plant's growth response to environmental cues is called a tropism.
A few of the most common cues are light, gravity, and touch.
Phototropism is a plant's growth towards light; the uneven distribution of the hormone auxin causes the shoot to bend towards the light.
Gravitropism is a plant's response to gravity; growing towards gravity, as in roots, is positive gravitropism while growing away from gravity, as in shoots, is negative gravitropism.
Thigmotropism describes the development of a plant according to touch.
Some plants grow towards touch while others grow away from touch; this touch can be either mechanical stimulation or contact with a surface or object.
There are many hormones that control plant growth.
The five many groups of hormones are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
An auxin is any substance that stimulates shoot growth.
Auxins also suppress lateral growth causing a balance in chemicals called apical dominance.
Cytokinins stimulate cell division and regulate pathway differentiation; they also stimulate lateral branching and balance with auxins for apical dominance.
Gibberellins' most obvious effect is the stimulation of cell division and elongation in stems; high doses of gibberellins cause very tall and spindly plants in a phenomenon known as bolting.
Abscisic acid inhibits growth buds and vascular cambium; this hormone can induce dormancy and is therefore used in droughts and other stressful environments.
Finally, ethylene is a gaseous compound that inhibits growth and aids in the aging process of plants; this hormone balances with auxin to coordinate the growing season.
In this experiment, the growth of plants will be explored through manipulation of growing conditions.
The first manipulation is of the known tropisms.
In this case, gravitropism and thigmotropism are manipulated.
One would expect the marigold shoots to grow upward in negative tropism and for the marigold to grow away from the mechanical stimulation of wind.
The second manipulation is by spraying the plants with a particular hormone.
The hormones are unknown so the effects can not be predicted but hopefully with knowledge about various hormones we will be able to deduce which particular families of hormones are used.
