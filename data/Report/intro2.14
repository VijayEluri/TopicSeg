In this experiment, students studied the effects of unknown plant hormones on their plant's growth.
There are five major classes of hormones identified: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins promote cell elongation and also play a role in apical dominance.
Cytokinins stimulate cell division and regulate differentiation.
They work in combination with auxin to regulate growth patterns.
Another class of hormones associated with cell elongation are gibberellins.
Bolting, a rapid growth in stem elongation, is caused by high doses of gibberellins.
Abscisic acid, produced in the terminal buds, inhibits growth of buds and vascular cambium.
Ethlyene, a gaseous compound that is associated with senescence, diffuses through cells and acts as a growth inhibitor.
The purpose of this lab is to determine the hormone used, or the inhibitor of the hormone used.
The proposed outcomes are that the treatment will either promote or inhibit growth of the plant.
The data collected will show the differences in plant characteristics from week to week compared to a control from which students will be able to conclude the status of their treatment.
