Plants are essential to life on Earth.
"They serve as a food source for both humans and animals and by releasing their waste products into the environment they inadvertently replenish the Earth's oxygen supply.
In addition, plants prevent soil erosion, slow down wind movement, cool the atmosphere, provide habitats for wildlife and are now even being utilized as a source for fuel" (Van Der Zaden).
It is hard to imagine how dependent the human life is on the successfulness of a single plant, yet with years of study, researchers have managed to learn the underpinnings of how a plant grows and develops and have used this knowledge to for advancement in agriculture.
Plants display a much different form of growth as compared to humans.
Indeterminate growth is a continual process, in which plants continue to grow and differentiate throughout their life span in response to "environmental cues and internal signals" (Cyr and Paradise).
These environmental factors include light, water, humidity, nutrition and temperature.
Any growth changes resulting from the environment are called tropisms.
Included within this category are phototropism, gravitropism, and thigmotropism; response to light, gravity and touch accordingly.
Also influencing growth and development are plant hormones.
Plant hormones are organic compounds that function as growth stimulators or inhibitors.
For example, they can "affect flowering; aging; root growth; distortion and killing of leaves, stems, and other parts; prevention or promotion of stem elongation; color enhancement of fruit; prevention of leafing and/or leaf fall; and many other conditions" (Van Der Zaden).
In order to do work, the hormones are transported to the necessary area within a plant affecting its cell growth, elongation and differentiation (Cyr and Paradise).
In most cases, a single aspect of growth and development is influenced by several hormones.
There are five well known and studied hormones: Auxin, Cytokinins, Gibberellins, Abscisic Acid, and Ethylene.
"Very small concentrations of these substances produce major growth changes" (Van Der Zaden).
The purpose the Plant Hormone Lab was to test the effect an unknown compound had on the growth of pea seedlings.
Not knowing what kind of compound is being used, it can not be hypothesized what type of growth change will be seen, (i.e.: stimulated or inhibited) it can only be said that some sort of change is expected to be seen from the data collected over the two week experiment.
