Plants possess the ability to respond to their environment once their environment has been altered.
Displaying indeterminate growth, or continuing to grow and differentiate without genetic limitations, plants adjust to their environment to better increase their ability to reproduce more efficiently.
Many plants do this through the transportation of plant hormones throughout to all parts of the plant.
These plant hormones are produced throughout the plant and affect numerous areas all over the plant.
There are five major classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene (Lab Manual, 1).
How does each of these plant hormones affect the plant's growth and existence?
Any substance that promotes the growth and elongation of shoots, or coleoptiles, is considered an auxin.
The major function of auxin is to stimulate the elongation of the young cells of the coleoptiles.
Produced in the apical meristem of shoots, auxin travels down the plants to the site where it will promote cell growth and elongation at young shoots.
This downward migration of auxin down the plant creates apical dominance, meaning that auxin suppresses the growth of lateral buds that would eventually become lateral shoots.
The next group of plant hormones, the cytokinins, helps stimulate cell division and helps regulate the plant's differentiation.
Cytokinins are produced in embryos, fruits, or roots, or any actively growing tissues on the plant.
As they are synthesized within the roots, cytokinins are transported up the plant through the xylem.
Certain ratios of levels of cytokinins and levels of auxins helps determine whether that part of the plant will differentiate into a root or into a shoot.
Because of these balance of ratios, there is more branching, or lateral bud growth, closer to the plant's root system.
Gibberellins help stimulate stem elongation, the growing of fruit, and the germination of seeds.
If a plant was to receive high doses of gibberellin, the plant would grow very tall and windy, referred to as bolting.
On the contrary, if the plant receives low doses of gibberellin, the plant would grow extremely short, referred to as dwarfism.
Produced within the terminal buds, abscisic acid inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
By inhibiting this growth, abscisic acid helps plants cope with severe environmental conditions like drought, by stimulating the closure of the stomata openings preventing water loss.
Nearly all of the water lost by a plant is through the stomata (Raven and Johnson).
Ethylene, a growth inhibitor, is a gas that diffuses into the plant's pores.
It quickens the aging process and causes leaves, fruits, and flowers to fall from the plant, known as abscission.
In balance with auxin, auxin counteracts the effects of ethylene and helps balance and prolong the plant's life cycle.
As auxin levels decrease within leaves or fruits or flowers, ethylene levels increasing causing them to fall from the plant.
How does a plant respond to higher or lower concentrations of these plant hormones?
The purpose of this experiment is to attempt to predict which hormones or inhibitors are being sprayed onto the pea plants by measuring the number of internodes, the plant's total height, and the average internode length over a two week period compared to the control.
These measured data will show whether the plant's growth has been inhibited or whether the plant's growth has been promoted.
If the plant's growth is promoted, the hormone could be either auxin or possibly high doses gibberellin.
If the plant's growth is inhibited, the inhibitor could possibly be abscisic acid or low doses of gibberellin.
