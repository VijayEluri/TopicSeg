Plant hormones or growth factors are an important part of the plants life.
Without these hormones they would not be able to do simple things that promote their survival.
Each hormone has a multitude of jobs to accomplish just to keep the plant healthy.
For example, the hormone group Auxin controls the elongation of shoots and is the major reason that plants express apical dominance.
Apical dominance is an adaptation that allows all parts of the plant to get light, a good example of this is the Christmas tree, these trees exhibit apical dominance and you can see it in its shape, the smaller branches are at the top thus allowing all of the lower parts of the tree to gather light for photosynthesis.
Auxin may also help in preventing premature fruit drop in citrus plants (contributing writer).
Another type of hormone is Ethylene; this hormone is a gas and the only known gaseous hormone used.
This gaseous hormone inhibits growth and is a major player in the maturation or ripening of fruits and the abscission (shedding) of leaves.
The class of Gibberellins works together with Auxin to increase stem elongation.
These are just a few examples of how important hormones can be to plants, there are many more categories of hormones and more are being found every year.
Tropisms are growth responses to environmental stressors such as wind or gravity.
Examination of some tropisms were observed in this lab with marigold plants but will not be discussed here.
The purpose of this lab is to examine plant growth when the hormone balance has been altered.
We will examine how the plant grows with the hormones altered and then try to figure out what hormone has been altered.
The data will show that the hormone treatments were both something to do with Gibberellins, one an activator and one an inhibitor.
