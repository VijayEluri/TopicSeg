Plants, in order to survive and grow, interact with their environment.
Plants sense factors in their environment and then use these signals to achieve a physiological, growth or developmental response.
As part of the internal signaling system of plants, hormones help to bring about plant response to environment and the hormones themselves are usually correlated with the environment.
Basically, plant hormones are the factors that allow plant development to adjust to the environment (Raven, 2002).
"Hormones are chemical substances produced in small quantities in one part of an organism and then transported to another part, where they bring about physiological or developmental responses.
The activity of hormones results from their capacity to stimulate certain physiological processes and to inhibit others" (Raven, 2002).
The seven major kinds of plant hormones are auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, brassinosteriods, oligosacchrins, ethylene and abscisic acid (Raven, 2002).
Tropisms are growth responses, either positive or negative, of plants to external stimuli that usually come from one direction.
Three major classes of tropisms are phototropism, gravitropism and thigmotropism.
Phototropic responses usually involve the bending of growing stems and other plants parts toward sources of light.
"Stems are positively phototropic, growing towards the light source, while most roots do not respond to light or exhibit only a weak negative phototropic response"(Raven, 2002).
Phototropic responses are adaptive characteristics of plants that allow for them to gain as much sunlight as possible.
Gravitropism is the response of a plant to the gravitational field of the earth.
Finally, thigmotropism is a response of a plant or plant part to contact with the touch of an object, animal, plant or even the wind (Raven, 2002).
Through this experiment, the three types of plant tropisms are going to be examined by placing plants in different environmental conditions to examine the tropism effect that will occur as a result of a specific environment.
Furthermore, by applying unknown compounds and then measuring plant growth characteristics over a set time period, we will investigate the effects of unknown compounds on plant growth.
From the collected data, the identity of the unknown will be determined (Biology 240W, 2004).
