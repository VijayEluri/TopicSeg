Although many students in biology class quiver at the sound of the word plant, they soon realize how amazing these organisms are after only a few days of learning.
Most of the reasoning for the dislike of plants is because they are not very fun to look at and do not appear to do anything special at first notice.
However, plants have to perform many of the same life-essential functions as animals while being stationary.
They do not have the luxury of muscles, a nervous system or an immune system.
One may think that plants are no match for animals regarding these functions, but they somehow manage to perform these tasks just as good as animals, if not better.
Plants can also do things that animals cannot do.
One of their most unique qualities is their indeterminate growth, that is, they grow with no genetically predefined limits.
Otherwise stated, plants can continue to grow and differentiate throughout their entire lives, and the program for development remains plastic (Leicht and Price, 1994).
Animals are actually dependent on plants to harvest the primary input of energy in the biosphere: sunlight.
Without plant photosynthesis to convert this energy into a usable form for animals, the world would not be anything like it is today.
The air we breathe would not even be the same, as plant photosynthesis led to a transformation of an anaerobic to aerobic environment.
The importance of plants in the environment is unmatched by anything, and they have shaped the world to become what it is today.
As previously stated plants are immobilized and are unable to get up and move if they do not like environmental conditions.
How then, have plants been so successful over the course of history?
It is the plants remarkable ability to respond and adapt to the environment that plays a major role in their success.
They can manipulate their growth factors by using both external and internal signals and often use combinations of the two.
Scientists are always investigating and questioning the mechanisms that plants use to drive such responses.
The growth responses of plants to environmental cues or other external stimuli are called tropisms (Leicht and Price, 1994).
The most common tropisms are responses to light, gravity and touch.
On the other hand, the internal signals are where the true mystery lies.
Among the most important internal signals are chemical messengers known as plant hormones that are produces in small quantities in one part of the plant, and are transported to other areas where they exert their effects.
Five major classes of hormones have been identified; auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene.
Auxins are defined as any substance that promotes shoot growth.
IAA, the only natural occurring auxin, functions to stimulate you shoot cell elongation.
Synthetic auxins have uses in agriculture and horticulture.
Cytokinins are a group of hormones that both stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
They also stimulate lateral bud growth.
There is more branching where cytokinin levels are higher.
Gibberellins have a variety of effects on plant growth including stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination.
High doses of gibberellin cause plants to grow very tall and spindly (called bolting), and low doses cause dwarfism.
Abscisic acid is a hormone that inhibits the growth of buds and the vascular cambium.
This hormone is very important in helping the plant cope during stressful environmental conditions, especially water stress.
Ethylene, a simple gaseous compound, acts as a growth inhibitor.
The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effects of unknown compounds have on plant growth and differentiation, and then to identify the compounds.
In the identification of compounds, there are generally two major groups that can be pinpointed, growth promoters and growth inhibitors.
The growth promoters are auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins, while the inhibitors are abscisic acid and ethylene.
Once it is known if the unknown treatment is a promoter or inhibitor, the three variables (plant height, number of internodes and average internode length) as well as the concentration of the treatment can be investigated to find any correspondence with any of the five major plant hormone classes (Raven and Johnson, Ch. 41).
