The ability of plants to show indeterminate growth distinguishes them from other living organisms.
Plants keep growing without any genetically predisposed limit, but their morphology and physiology are tuned to their surrounding by an interaction of environmental cues and internal signals.
Growth factors or hormones are the most important internal signals in plants, with five major classes; each hormone has a variety of effects, depending on the site of action, developmental stage of plant and its concentration.
The five major classes of hormones are Auxins, Cytokinins, Gibberellins, Abscisic acid and Ethylene.
The table below describes the functions of each hormone acting alone and in the presence of other hormones:
Table 1:
Plant Hormones.
Functions when Acting Independently.
Functions when Acting Dependently.
Auxin:
Promotes elongation of Shoot Growth.
Example Indole3-acetic acid whose function is to stimulate elongation of cells in young shoots.
It is synthesized in the apical meristem of the shoot.
The ratio of cytokinins to auxin in a cell determines whether it will differentiate as a root or shoot.
While auxin suppresses lateral bud growth, cytokinin stimulates it.
Cytokinins:
The stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
It is synthesized in the roots
Gibberellins:
Their effects include stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
High doses of gibberellin causes plant to grow tall and spindly (Bolting).
When in an Abnormally low dose causes dwarfism.
Acting with auxin, gibberellins stimulates cell division and elongation in stems.
Abscisic Acid
Produced in terminal buds, inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
It promotes Dormancy.
Ethylene:
Ethylene acts as a growth inhibitor.
It causes the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
The natural Balance of auxin and ethylene control the timing of the plants life cycle.
Plant will react to any substance that is applied to it either by showing no response or by responding in a way that depends on the particular substance.
Plants can show the responses according to table 1 if sprayed with the right hormone.
But can plants counteract the effects of other substance that are applied to them, by showing a different effect than the intended effect of the applied substance?
The pea seedling plants in this experiment are treated with two unknown substances with different concentrations in the following pattern:
Two plants receive- control treatment, another two plants receive -treatment one that is in a high concentration, another two plants receive -treatment one that is in low concentration.
Following the pattern of two plants to one treatment, treatment two in low and high concentration are applied.
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of unknown compounds on plant height, number of internodes (the segment of a plant stem between the points where leaves are attached) and the average lengths of each individual internode combinded.
This experiment will help determine whether there is a significant difference between plants treated with the unknown substances and those that grow naturally meaning those treated with the control.
These differences will focus on the average % change in plant's height, number of internodes and the average lengths of the internodes.
Although the names of treatment one and treatment two are not know, they are bound to exhibit the functions of either one hormone listed in table 1.
Some of the effects could include shoot growth, stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination.
They might even cause the death of the plant or show no effects at all.
The composition of treatment one and two will be determined after correct data analyses are conducted for height, number of internodes and internode length.
Those analyses are then graphed and tabulated.
