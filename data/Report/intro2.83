The general purpose of this lab experiment was to learn about plant growth and how it is affected by different hormones.
Our experiment had to take place over a period of time because plants take time to grow.
The strategy that we adopted to ensure success in the experiment was using two plants for each hormone concentration, and using two plants as controls.
These control plants were given water with no hormones, so they would grow normally.
What we hoped to learn in performing this experiment was how the hormones used affected the growth of their subjects, the pea plants, and in examining how the plants were affected we hoped to deduce what hormones may have been used on each group of plants.
