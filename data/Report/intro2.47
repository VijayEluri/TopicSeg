When observing plants its success is usually measured in the plant's ability to grow.
When looking at the factors when considering plant growth it is important to not the chemical processes and the environment that is affecting the plants growth.
When considering the environmental consequences one of the first growing impact a tropisms.
The three major classes of tropisms are Gravitropism, phototropism, and thigmotropism.
Gravitropism has to do with how the plant responds to gravity.
The upward growth of gravitropism is responsible for the plants upward growth toward sunlight.
Phototropism is responsible for the plant growing towards a major light source.
Thigmotropism is responsible for a plants growth due to touch.
(Lab Manual 1) A side experiment was done during this lab to test the effects of tropisms on a plant.
This concluded that if a plant was placed upside-down it would grow upward due to gravity.
The second major idea when considering plant growth is the plants regulation of hormones.
In a plant the hormones are produced in a variety of areas and can affect a variety of different tissues.
This differs from animals in that in animals hormones are only produced in specific areas and target specific tissues.
The five major classes of plant hormones are: Auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
(Lab Manual, 1)
One of the major types of hormones, auxins, promotes elongation of the coleoptile.
Auxins stimulates the elongation of cells in shoots .
Plants exposed to large sources of auxins would be tall with few lateral shoots because auxins suppress lateral bud growth (Ross 1).
When looking at cytokinins we tend to see shorter plants produced.
Cytokinin stimulates lateral bud growth.
Therefore a plant that has been exposed to cytokinins would be shorter but with a higher number of nodes.(Campbell, 810)
Gibberellins causes stem elongation and also seed germination.
Since this causes the stem elongation plants treated with Gibberellins tend to be very tall and spinally.(Campbell 812)
The last two hormones are abscisic acid and ethylene.
Abscisic acid inhibits the growth of the vascular cambium and growth of buds.
This would in turn cause the plants to stay relatively short.
Ethylene is responsible for inhibiting growth and causing a ripening of fruit.
This experiment was carried out in order to find out the effects of unknown compounds on plants and then to determine the unknown compound.
When looking at this experiment these compounds will be able to be determined bases on the outcomes of the plants.
By measuring physical characteristics such as overall height, amount of nodes, and internodes length the unknown chemical should be able to be predicted based on the known effects of the five kinds of hormones.
If the plant grows a lot taller then gibberellin and auxin would be closely examined as the unknown hormone.
If the plant experiences and abnormally small amount of growth then cytokinin, abcisic acid and possibly ethylene will be more closely examined.
