Similar to how humans have growth hormones to regulate growth in the cell and tissues, Plants have internal signals which interact with the environment to alter its morphology and physiology.
These signals are referred to as plant hormones, and there are five major classes of plant hormones: Auxins, Cytokinins, gibberellins, absciscic acid, and ethylene.
The word Auxin in Greek means "to grow" thus based on the name, this type of hormone induces cell elongation in stems.
This elongation usually takes place at the coleoptiles, which "is a specialized leaf originating from the first node which sheaths the epicotyl in the plants seedling stage protecting it until it emerges from the ground" (Darwin 1).
When unidirectional light shines on this portion of the part, then the plant bends toward the light.
Thus, an experiment by Darwin concluded that the "tissue responsible for perceiving the light and producing some signal which was transported to the lower part of the coleoptile where the physiological response of bending occurred" (Darwin 1)).
Cytokinins promote cell division, and "are chemically related to the nucleotide adenine" (Raven and Johnson 2).
Cytokinins tend to be found in higher concentrations in meristematic regions and growing tissues; they are synthesized in the roots and then translocated via xylem to the shoots.
Some of the physiological affects from these plants include: stimulates cell division and growth of lateral buds, enhance stomatal opening, and stimulate leaf expansion (McGaw 1).
There are about 80 different forms of Gibberellins (GA), which have thee different functions.
First, extensive growth in plant occurs because GA controls internode elongation and cellular division in the mature regions of plants.
Also, because absorption of water stimulates the embryo to release gibberellins, seed germination results in movement of stored food reserves of the seed.
Lastly, fruit formation is seen in the use of GA, such as increase in the size of seedless grapes (Plant Hormones 1).
Abscisic Acid (ABA) is made from carotenoids and helps with the closure of the stomata to help prevent droughts.
This is a result of the hormones trait to promote dormancy.
Ethylene is the most unusual compared to the rest of plant hormones, mainly because it is a gas.
Ethylene acts as a growth inhibitor; most commonly it is known for promoting the ripening of the fruit.
Other functions of this hormone include: abscission of leaves, fruits, and flower petals, the drooping of leaves, flower formation, and sprouting of potato buds (Kimball 1).
With this useful information of the affects of different hormones, one may wonder about the effect of these hormones at different concentrations.
If a plant has a high concentration of a certain hormone, would it affect it in a negative or positive way?
Would the low concentration be enough for the plant to show any affect?
These are the some of the questions that can be derived.
In this experiment, unknown compounds which for plant growth are sprayed on individual plants, then based on the outcome of the plant, the unknowns can be determined.
It was proposed that the plants induced wit the highest concentration compound would experience the most change in growth, then the plants with the lowest concentration, and lastly the water treatment plants would grow but not as significant as the treatment given plants.
Moreover, the treatment which promotes growth would be a hormone inhibitor and the plants which show little change most likely were infected with a suppressor hormone.
