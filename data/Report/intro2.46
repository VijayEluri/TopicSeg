Environmental factors such as climate, nutrition, and contact affect not only animals but the plant world.
Plant response measures are drastically different that those of their animal counterparts.
The growth that plants continue to undergo and the differentiation throughout their lives is considered indeterminate growth (Burpee et al., 2004).
Plants use growth to react to environmental cues because they can not use a fight or flight response that is noticeably used by animals.
This continuous growth is considered to be known as plasticity (Burpee et al).
Growth factors or plant hormones are small chemical messengers that provide signals for such previously mentioned growth (Burpee et al).
Most scientific research has identified five separate classes of plant hormones including auxin, cytokinin, gibberelin, abscisic acid and ethylene.
Each of these plant hormones has various effects on an an individual plant.
Hormones are chemical substances produced in small, often minute, quantities in one part of an organism and then transported to another part, where they bring about physiological or developmental responses (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Plant hormones unlike animals are produced in a variety of areas in the plant and can exert their effects on a variety of different tissues.
These areas of hormone affect can include cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination, flowering, and senescence (Burpee et al),
Auxins include any chemical substance that promotes elongation of coleoptiles (Burpee et al).
Indole 3-acetic acid commonly referred to as IAA is the only naturally occurring auxin and causes the stimulation of elongation of cells of young shots and growth reaction toward areas of light (Burpee et al).
This auxin is synthesized at the apical meristem and travels downward to the cell elongation area.
It is at this time that the increase in IAA can cause apical dominance, the suppression of lateral bud growth which is commonly seen in Christmas tree growth.
The stimulation of cell division and regulation of differentiation is commonly contributed to cytokinin levels.
Production of cytokinins occurs in tissue of developing embryos, fruits, and roots (Burpee et al ).
This plant hormone is transported through the use of xylem from the roots and is normally found in combination with other plant hormones.
Cytokinin and auxin are generally found together in plants and help determine the growth of shoots or roots by varying concentrations.
This affect also is found to control apical dominance (Burpee et al).
Auxin is found to suppress lateral growth; however, cytokinin is found to promote the lateral bud growth of most plants (Burpee et al).
This affect helps to explain why lateral bud growth is more prevalent on the stem portion closer to the roots than that found at the apex.
Stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination are all effected by the presence of gibberellins, GA3 in plants (Burpee et al).
Gibberellins, which are commonly found to act with auxin in plants, predominately help to stimulate stem elongation and cell division.
Plant hormone concentrations can also have a negative affect on plants.
The growth phenomena of bolting can occur by rapid cell division with increased gibberellin concentration and can cause plants to be long and spindly.
Abscisic acid, ABA is produced in terminal buds, and generally inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium (Burpee et al).
This affect provides a means of environmental adaptation to such environmental affects as drought.
The plant is placed in a state of dormancy due to the ABA concentration.
The stomata of the plant close resulting in water retention.
This water retention prevents water loss normally associated with drought conditions (Burpee et al)
Gaseous ethylene serves as a growth inhibitor in plants and helps to prevent senescence of leaves, flowers, and fruits (Burpee et al).
This hormone is generally found in combination with auxin .
The combination of auxin and ethylene is noticeable in plants by the dropping of leaves and fruits at relatively the same time (Burpee et al).
This experiment will investigate the effects of unknown compounds on pea plant growth.
The unknown compounds will be identified by the completion of the experiment with respect to the relative affects that plant hormones have on plants as previously described.
