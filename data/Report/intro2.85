Plants are organisms like any type of animal, releasing hormones to direct growth and development in different parts of the plant.
However, plants have very specific target tissues where they direct their hormones, and most hormones are produced in many different areas, thus giving plants the ability t have indeterminate growth, which is the ability to grow and differentiate throughout their lives.
Plants are able to release different types of hormones in order to be able to respond to different environments.
There are five major classes of plant hormones; auxins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins promote elongation of coleoptiles (Burpee, 2004), and inhibit plant growth outward.
The only known naturally occurring auxin is indole 3-acetic acid (Burpee, 2004).
Cytokinins are hormones that stimulate growth outward, and are produced in actively growing tissues, especially in embryos, fruits, and roots (Burpee, 2004).
Cytokinins work in combination with other hormones to regulate growth patterns, and are a major part in controlling apical dominance.
Gibberellins are hormones that promote stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
High doses of gibberellin causes plants to grow very tall and thin.
Low doses causes dwarfish (Burpee, 2004).
Abscisic acid, is a hormone which inhibits the growth of buds and other tissues.
It promotes dormancy, which is very useful in periods of nutritional dearth or drought.
Ethylene, the last class of hormones, is a gaseous compound that diffuses through the air spaces between cells.
It is a growth inhibitor, and functions in the aging process.
Its most common use is for the ripening of fruits, which is used commercially worldwide to prevent early spoilage.
Plants release these hormones in response to environmental stimulations called tropisms.
Phototropism is gravitation towards light, which is caused by uneven distribution of auxins (Burpee, 2004).
Gravitropism is the upward growth of parts of the plant toward the direction it wants.
Thigmotropism is growth in response to touch, and is seen by coiling of vines and other physical properties close to the plant.
The purpose of the experiment is to find out which types of hormones are in mystery hormones 1 and 2, and what type of effects do they have on the pea plants.
One type of hormone is an inhibitor, and one type will be a promoter.
Our hypothesis is that high concentrations of the promoter hormone will promote more growth than the low concentration and the control, and high concentrations of the inhibitor will inhibit more growth than the low concentration and control.
