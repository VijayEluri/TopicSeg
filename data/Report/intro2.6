Plants are some of the most unique organisms on Earth.
Unlike most organisms plants show indeterminate growth which means they can continue to grow and change throughout their lives.
Plants are also very good at adapting and interacting with their surrounding environment.
One way they are able to do this is through the use of plant hormones.
This is what the experiment explored.
Some of the hormones that plants utilize are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are responsible for the elongation of the plant shoot, cytokinins stimulate cell division and regulate differentiation, gibberellins stimulate stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination, abscisic acid promotes dormancy and water conservation in the plant, and ethylene acts as a growth inhibitor (Lab Manual 2004).
Some questions that will be addressed are what is the effect on plants treated with different compounds, what is the effect on plants treated with different concentration levels, and what plant hormone was used on the plants?
The purpose of this experiment was to see how plants react to hormones applied at different concentrations.
The data will show that plants respond well to additions of hormones by growing and developing at an increased rate.
