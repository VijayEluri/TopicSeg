Among the most important internal signals for a plant's morphology and physiology are plant hormones.
Plant hormones are produced in small quantities in one part of the plant and are then transported to other areas where they perform their function.
Each plant hormone has a multiplicity of effects, depending upon the site of action, developmental stage of the plant, and concentration of the hormone.
Among the important processes affected by plant hormones are cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination, flowering and senescence.
The five major classes of plant hormones are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are defined as any chemical substance that promotes shoot growth.
Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), which is the only known naturally occurring auxin, suppresses the growth of lateral buds while also stimulates the elongation of cells in young shoots.
Cytokinins are a group of plant hormones that both stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
Cytokinins usually work in combination with auxins and other hormones to regulate growth patterns.
Gibberellins have a variety of effects on plant growth including stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Acting with auxin, gibberellins help stimulate cell division and elongation in stems.
Abscisic acid inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
Ethylene acts as a growth inhibitor.
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of certain unknown compounds (plant hormones) have on plant growth.
It is predicted that one hormone is an enhancer, which will cause increased growth with increased concentration, and the other hormone is an inhibitor, which will cause decreased growth with increased concentration.
