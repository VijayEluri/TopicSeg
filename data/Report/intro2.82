Plants are any members of the plant kingdom, comprising about 260,000 known species of mosses, liverworts, ferns, herbaceous and woody plants, bushes, vines, trees, and various other forms that mantle the Earth and are also found in its waters.1 The growth and differentiation of the various plant tissue and organ systems are controlled by various internal and external factors.
Most plants have the property of indeterminate growth, they are able to continue to grow and differentiate throughout their lives, and the program for development remains somewhat plastic.
Plasticity allows a plant to adjust growth patterns to maximize reproductive success for a given set of environmental conditions.
Plant hormones are specialized in the chemical substances produced by plants.
They are the main internal factors controlling growth and development.
Hormones are produced in one part of a plant and transported to others, where they are effective in very small amounts.
Depending on the target tissue, a given hormone may have different effects.
Most plant hormones are produced in a variety of areas in the plant and can exert their effects on a variety of different tissues.
Each hormone has a multiplicity of effects, depending upon the site of action, developmental stage of the plant, and concentration of the hormone.
Some different affects of plant hormones are effects of cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, etc. on plants.
There are five major classes of plant hormones that have been identified.
Auxin is one of the most important plant hormones.
It is produced by growing stem tips and transported to other areas where it may either promote growth or inhibit it.
In stems, for example, auxin promotes cell elongation and the differentiation of vascular tissue, whereas in roots it inhibits growth in the main system but promotes the formation of adventitious roots.
It also retards the abscission (dropping off) of flowers, fruits, and leaves.
Cytokinins also have some control on promoting the growth of lateral buds that auxins sometimes inhibit.
It also stimulates cell division and slows the process of aging.
Gibberellins encourage growth by means of stem elongation and the growth of new leaves.
They have a variety of effects on plant growth including fruit growth, and seed germination.
Abscisic acid unlike the others above actually inhibits growth and promotes dormancy to help plants get through periods of stress when water is not readily available.
Ethylene promotes maturation and ripening of fruits, as well as the abscission of leaves from trees in the fall.
Through the use of these hormones, plants are able to grow and adjust to their environment.
There is a safe chemical that can be applied to crabapple trees during the flowering stage to retard or reduce the growth of fruit on the tree.
Christopher in Englewood A: Florel Brand Fruit Eliminator uses the active ingredient Ethephon to stem fruiting.
Ethephon is absorbed by plant tissues and converted into a natural plant hormone called Ethylene.
The only gaseous plant hormone, Ethylene was used by the ancient Egyptians to stimulate the ripening of figs, but it was not until 1901 that the hormone was identified by modern science.
In this paper it was questioned what would be the result of different plant hormones being applied in varying concentrations.
The plant response of this was unknown.
All these questions will be addressed and answered in this paper.
The purpose of this experiment is to observe the change in growth of the pea plants under the varying conditions of a chemical and determine the name of the chemical/unknown hormone used in this experiment from information found in research.
The indicators of growth to be used in this experiment, which are also the variables, include the number of internodes present the length of the internodes, and the length of the entire pea plant from the start of the first internode to the apex of the plant.
After comparing the background material with the results it would seem apparent that if after being treated with a plant hormone for one week the plant does not grow, the unknown hormone used was abscisic acid, and if it does indeed grow a large amount the hormone is most likely Auxin, which is primarily responsible for shoot elongation in plants.
Also, as one increases the concentration of the hormone one would also expect the effect, whatever it maybe, to increase.
Procedure:
In this experiment it was imperative to investigate the effects of unknown compounds on the plant growth, and then identify the unknown compounds.
The protocol of this experiment was taken from the Biology 240W Lab Manual Version 2004.
To accomplish this goal an experiment had to be designed and set up.
Each group was given six pea seedlings for their experiment.
A replica of each experimental experiment was set up with two pea plants and there were two control plants.
Each plant was labeled with a tag to distinguish from each.
On each tag the lab section number, code, and group's initial was given.
The unknown compounds had two concentrations, low and high.
Each group was assigned one concentration for both of their unknown compounds.
Each treatment had to be recorded to the appropriate plant number in a table in the Biology Lab Manual.
Each internode of each plant had to be counted and recorded in a table.
The data collection had to be concise and consistent.
The total plant height (mm) and the length of internodes (mm) for each plant had to be measured and recorded in a table.
To ensure consistency in measurements the person in the group that measured for week one also had to measure for the second week.
Each plant was sprayed with its unknown solution until the solution dripped off from the leaves.
Each plant was then taken to its appropriate light bank for its unknown compounds and controls.
During the second week the number of internodes for each plant had to be counted and recorded.
The total plant height (mm) and the length of new internodes (mm) for each plant had to be measured and recorded.
The percent difference had to be calculated, using ((measurement of week 2 - measurement of week 1) / measurement of week 1) * 100, for each of the four measurements.
Each calculated value had to be inserted into a table.
The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel by means of graphs, tables and manipulation of the data.
Each group had to submit their finalized data into a pooled class data set.
T-tests had to be applied to determine whether any differences in the controls and experimentals can be considered real or whether they only are due to random variation in the pea plants.
