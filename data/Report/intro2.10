The purpose of this experiment is to compare the growth trends of a plant when it was watered with different solutions and try to decipher the hormone or hormone inhibitor contained in the solution.
Plant hormones have a significant effect on plant growth.
Different hormones affect plants in different ways and the distribution of these hormones are responsible for the tropisms found in plants such as gravitropism and phototropism.
There are five major classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
All have different effects on plan growth and development.
Auxins are the main hormone involved in plant growth.
The presence of auxin in the stem of the plant causes growth and elongation of the cells while if the auxin is located in the roots of the plant, it prevents growth and elongation.
Indole 3-acetic acid is the only known naturally occurring auxin.
Auxin is primarily synthesized in the apical meristem of a plant.
The phenomena of apical dominance arises from the fact that auxin is secreted from the top of the stem.
High concentrations of auxin found at the top of the stem prevent the formation of branches and this helps to stop branches from forming at the top of the plant and shading the leaves beneath.
Redistribution of auxin to one side of the stem or the other is responsible for plants bending towards light.
Cytokinins are another hormone involved in plant growth.
They promote elongation and cell division and are important in balancing apical dominance.
Cytokinins are primarily developed in the roots and a high concentration of cytokinins help promote branching in the stem of the plant.
Gibberellins are also a hormone involved in plant growth.
Gibberellins are important in seed germination, internode elongation, floral development, and fruit growth.
Large doses of gibberellins cause plants to grow long and spindly while low doses can result in dwarfism (1).
Ethylene is unique among the hormones in that it is a gas.
It is a growth inhibitor and plays an important role in plant senescence.
Increased levels of ethylene causes ripening of fruits and this phenomenon are commonly used in the food industry to ripen out of season fruits just before they are placed in the market.
Ethylene is also responsible for abscission of the leaves in the fall causing them to fall off of the tree (2).
Abscisic acid is produced in the terminal buds of the plant and is known as the drought hormone.
Its activities are seen in droughted leaves and plants where it acts to prevent water loss by such mechanisms as stomatal pore closing.
Its actions counteract those of auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellins (2, 3).
