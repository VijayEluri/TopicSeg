Plants, like animals, must respond to stimuli in their environment.
Unlike animals plants are sessile so their responses must be in the form of altering their growth and development.
Plants are continuously growing and differentiating and therefore show indeterminate growth.
Almost all of plant communication is done through plant hormones, which are low concentration chemical messengers.
These hormones are internal signals that are activated by external environmental factors.
These hormones are produced in one part of the plant and transported to other areas of the plant through mainly diffusion.
A single plant hormone can have multiple effects on a plant depending on the target location of the hormone, developmental stage of the plant, and the concentration of the hormone1.
Several responses are triggered by more then one hormone and the specific ratio of each hormone regulates the responses.
The five most common hormones are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene gas.
Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) is the most common naturally occurring auxin, which is a class of plant hormones that promotes elongation of the shoot.
IAA stimulates elongation of cells in developing shoots.
It is synthesized in the apical meristem of shoots and moves downward through the shoot to the target area of elongation.
IAA prevents the growth of auxiliary buds limited lateral shoot growth therefore causing apical dominance.
Auxin controlled elongation is involved in both gravitropism, the growth of a pant based on gravity (roots downward, shoots upward) and phototropism, the response to a unidirectional source of light1.
Cytokinins are derivatives of the purine adenine, and they are plant hormones that promote cell division.
They are typically produced in developing embryos, fruits, and roots.
Cytokinins move through the roots to their target via xylem sap1.
They usually work with auxins to regulate the growth of a developing plant or regulate the adaptation of a plant to an environmental stimulus.
Cytokinins are also involved in apical dominance.
Gibberellins are growth promoting hormones that elongate cells.
Gibberellins are also essential to fruit growth and seed germination.
Gibberellins together with auxin stimulate cell division and cell elongation in shoots.
Bolting, plants growing tall and spindly, is caused by high doses of gibberellin1.
Abscisic acid(ABA) is a plant hormone produced in the terminal buds that have inhibitory properties.
ABA maintains seed dormancy and promotes the closure of stomata via potassium gated channels.
The last of the main plant hormones is ethylene gas.
Ethylene diffuses through the plant cells and acts as a growth inhibitor.
Ethylene is involved in the ripening of fruit and the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
Auxins are used to counter the aging effects of ethylene.
Therefore at the end of the growing season auxin levels decrease and ethylene levels increase causing the dropping of fruits and leaves.
A pea seedling has several important morphological characteristics.
First near the top of the plant is the apex, this is where the plant continues growing from.
There are several nodes, which are the spot of lateral shoot growth.
The distance between one node and the next is the internode.
The nodes can be identified by a lateral shoot and the presence of stipules (2 leaf-like structures).
The Control of Plant Growth: Plan Hormones lab is designed to determine the effect of unknown compounds on plant growth.
The lab involves treating several pea plants with unknown compounds and then monitoring the effects of these compounds on the growth of the plant.
Then the goal is to determine the possible identities of the unknown compounds.
The hypothesis was that if the unknown compound was a growth hormone it would cause a bigger change in internode length, total plant height, and number of internodes, but if it was an inhibitory hormone it would cause a decrease in total plant height, internode length and number of internodes.
Also high concentrations of the treatment would cause a more dramatic change then low concentrations of the hormone.
