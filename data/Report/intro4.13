In plants, hormones are responsible for the growth and development of specific regions of the plant, exerting their effects at a certain spot when they need to.
As plants show a pattern of indeterminate growth, hormones are essential for plant growth throughout their entire lives.
There are a number of different hormones that are now being used to produce desired effects in plants.
They can be used, for example as fertilizers and fruit ripeners.
Scientists have currently identified a number of different categories of plant hormones that work in the development of plants.
They include: the auxins, which promote elongation of shoot cells and are highly involved in apical dominance in plants; the cytokinins, which help to regulate lateral bud growth and act in concord with auxins to regulate apical dominance; the gibberellins, which produce internode elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination; abscisic acid, which aids in stomatal function, seed maturation, and seed dormancy; and ethylene, which, as a gas, can induce fruit ripening and abscission of leaves (Cyr, R.J.,2004).
Because these hormones have such a profound effect on plants and their existence, many researchers have set out to explore further the effects of hormones on plant growth and maturation.
What effects does increasing the concentration of one hormone have on plant development?
If a specific hormone is removed from a plant, will it still be able to grow and mature regularly?
These questions, along with countless others, have plagued plant biologists for centuries and continue to interest them even today.
The objective of this lab was to determine how pea seedling growth is affected by different hormones and different concentrations of these hormones.
After a week's growth, we wanted to see how some unknown hormones affected the development of the pea seedlings, and from this determine what hormone was acting on the plant.
Expected is a distinct elongation of the shoot if there is a high concentration of auxin acting on the plant, and another, but not as profound elongation of the shoot if a low concentration of auxin had been added to the plant.
If the compound added to the plant was an inhibitor of auxin, we would expect the plant to stay at relatively the same size with little stem elongation if there was a high concentration of this inhibitor added, and slightly more of an elongation, yet not nearly as much as in the control plant if a low concentration of auxin inhibitor was to be added.
If a cytokinin compound was added there should be a higher growth of lateral buds, being much higher with the addition of a high concentration and a little higher with the addition of a low concentration.
If a cytokinin inhibitor was added, there would not be much lateral bud growth, each regulated by the two different concentrations added.
If a gibberellin compound was added in a high concentration, expected would be a large growth in the distance between internodes, and a low concentration would produce a greater distance between internodes, but not as much so as the high concentration.
A gibberellin inhibitor would show a very small change in distance between internodes for a high concentration, and a little greater distance than this for a low concentration.
If an abscissic acid compound was added, there would be a minimal growth of buds for a low concentration and even less of a growth of buds for a high concentration.
An abscissic acid inhibitor would make lateral buds grow out at a greater rate, and a high concentration of inhibitor would allow more growth than a low concentration.
An ethylene compound would produce the abscission of leaves, more so in a high concentration than in a low one, and an inhibitor of ethylene would promote retention of leaves on the plant, again more so with a high concentration than a low one (Raven, 2002).
