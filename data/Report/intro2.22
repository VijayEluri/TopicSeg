Plants, much like other living organisms, are very sensitive to their environment and react accordingly.
The environment surrounding a plant gives it cues that allow it to alter its growth and development.
In order for the plant to react to those cues, it must transmitted by plant hormones, which are small chemical messengers produced within the plant.
Each hormone is produced in a specific part of the plant and has certain target areas or tissues within the plant on which they can exert their effect.
Every important developmental aspect of plants are affected, and sometimes controlled, by these plant hormones.
There are five major classes of plant hormones that have been identified, although others are likely to be discovered in the future.
The five classes are as follows: Auxin, which promotes elongation of shoots; cytokinins, which stimulate cell division and regulation differentiation; gibberellins, which cause stem elongation, seed germination, and fruit growth; abscisic acid, which inhibits bud growth, inhibits the growth of the vascular cambium, and promotes dormancy; and ethylene, which inhibits growth, controls abscision of leaves, and affects senescence (Cyr R.J 1-2).
The hormones listed above are produced naturally within a plant.
But what effect would these chemical messengers have if sprayed upon the plant?
This experiment was performed to test the effects of two unknown hormone solutions upon plant growth; thus, it also raised the question of the hormones' identities.
Because the chemicals applied to the plants were unknown, the hypothesis was the data would show that the treatments affected plant growth, but the hypothesis did not specify in what way the growth would be affected or how large (or small) the effect would be.
This hypothesis was based on the knowledge that all of the hormones listed previously affect plant growth and development in some way.
