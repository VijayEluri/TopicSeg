In the plant world there are five main hormones, which the plant produces to regulate and adapt to the environment in which the plant is present.
Each of the hormones has different effects on the plant.
Some hormones cause the plant to grow on the darker side of the plant so that the plant is facing the light that is pointed towards it.
This hormone is called auxin.
It also is the hormone, which causes apical dominance in the plant.
This means that the branches towards the top of the plant will not grow so that the apex of the tree may receive full light, but as the apex grows further and further away from the branches they begin to grow.
This is seen in the Christmas tree shape.
Another type of hormone stimulates cell division.
The type of hormone that stimulates these actions is a group called cytokinins.
Cytokinins are produced in roots and fruits and other actively growing tissues.
This hormone works with auxin and other hormones to usually regulate the growth of the plant.
To make a plant grow extremely quickly, gibberellins are the hormones needed.
Gibberellins are a type of hormone, which cause rapid internode elongation, seed germination and floral development.
In moderate amounts the use of gibberellins can speed up the developing plant into a fully functional plant ready to produce fruits.
In all plants, the hormone used to ripen the fruits is ethylene.
This gas is used to ripen fruit, inhibit bud growth, inhibit flowering, water logging, and causes abscission.
When a plant is drowning in water ethylene pockets are made in the roots of the plants which will form a tube that will lead to the surface of the dirt so that O2 may reach the roots that way.
After a plant has ripened a fruit or needs to shed it's leaves ethylene is produced and a clean cut is made at the connection between the leaf or fruit and the branch it's attached to.
The final hormone that plants use to adapt to their environment is abscisic acid.
While the first thought was that this hormone caused abscission in plant, hence the name of the acid, the actual use of this hormone is in water regulation in the plant.
The purpose of this lab is to determine what the effect certain unknown hormones might have on pea plants after being sprayed with the unknown treatment for a week.
One main change that we expect to see to determine the hormone each unknown is would be a dramatically lengthening of shoots.
This characteristic would suggest auxin, low concentrations of cytokinins, or high concentrations of gibberellins.
A dramatically shorter plant as compared to the controls might suggest a high concentration of cytokinins, low concentration of gibberellins, or ethylene.
A visible observation wouldn't really be detected if abscisic acid were sprayed on the plants.
In this lab there are several questions that might be considered while examining the data, and actually performing the experiment itself.
Some of those questions are, how will the technique of spraying the plants change the way the plants react to the treatment?
What do the T-test values tell us about the differences in plant height, internode lengths and number of internodes between the control plants and those plants being treated with either of the treatments?
And other such questions as these.
