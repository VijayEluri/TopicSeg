Plants present many interesting discussions concerning their development and way of life.
They are influenced by the environment in countless ways, have various response mechanisms in place to handle stimuli, are capable of displaying indeterminate growth, and have many processes similar to those of animals.
One such of these methods is control of growth through hormones.
These are chemical signals that promote or inhibit certain occurrences within the plant tissues.
There are five main classes of plant hormones (although the text for this course lists seven, the primary hormones are listed as follows): Auxin (promotes elongation of shoots), cytokinins (stimulate cell division hence "kinin" and regulate the process in which cells differentiate and become unique), gibberllins (promote stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination), abscisic acid (inhibits growth of buds and vascular cambium), and finally ethylene (a gas that inhibits growth and functions in abscission of leaves, flowers, as well as fruits).
Plants exhibit varied responses to hormones.
These responses to assorted stimuli are deemed "tropisms". Gravitropism is defined as the ascendant expansion of the upper sections of a plant toward sunlight and the downward growth of roots where the plant can obtain water and minerals.
Phototropism occurs when the shoot of a plant grows toward a unidirectional supply of light and enables the plant to guarantee photosynthesis by always facing the light source.
Thigmotropism occurs when a plant comes into contact with something (a surface or object) and grows toward that object.
Vines are able to grow the way they do because of this response from plants.
There are important queries to be made concerning plant hormones and their effect on plant development.
Can one easily tell by observing various tropisms what kind of hormone is acting on the plant?
Are all hormones produced in a certain quantity, or are different amounts required for balance and homeostasis in plants?
And lastly, what are some implications to society of humans utilizing plant hormones to their own benefit?
The purpose of this lab is to examine various effects of two hormones and predict their origin (what hormone was used).
The hypothesis will be as follows: The data will be examined and based on the preliminary group data, it will be observed that treatment one could be either a hormone or an inhibitor, and treatment two will possibly some type of inhibitor.
