The ability of plants to respond to their environments is a result of the five classes of hormones that are known to affect the development and activity of plants.
The hormones are produced within the plant's cells and travel throughout the plant to elicit a response based on the specific tissue the hormone is affecting.
Hormones can be triggered by an environmental stimulus and act to inhibit or activate a variety of activities, either alone or in conjunction with one another.
The five classes of plant hormones are: auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid.
The actions of auxin are often triggered by light.
The presence of auxin in a region of a plant will cause the cells in that region to elongate.
Elongation occurs as a result of increased plasticity of the cell walls (due to auxin) and a cell's internal turgor pressure.
Auxin is abundant in regions of plants that are oriented away from a light source.
As auxin accumulates on the dark side of a plant, the cells on this side begin to elongate allowing the plant to grow towards the light source.
Auxin is also an important hormone involved in the development of fruits.
Cytokinins often act in tandem with auxin to promote cell division and differentiation of plant cells.
For example, cytokinins promote the change of lateral buds into branches.
Cytokinin allied with auxin acts to balance the formation of roots and branches - differentiation - in growing plants.
Gibberellins are also closely associated with auxin and work to stimulate stem elongation.
Gibberellins are produced in the apical roots and apical shoots and exist in many forms.
Ethylene is unique as a gaseous hormone, allowing it to affect not only the plant in which it is produced but also allowing it to affect nearby plants.
One of the most important functions of ethylene is the promotion of the ripening of fruit, breaking carbohydrates in developing fruits into simple sugars.
Ethylene itself is stimulated by the movement of auxin through the stem of a plant and also affects leaf abscision.
Abscisic acid is believed to be an important hormone during drought and winter.
Abscisic acid suppresses some of the activity of gibberellins during winter so that the plant does not lose valuable resources to growing new parts.
Abscisic acid is also involved in opening and closing stomata.
Although a plant produces its own hormones, topical application of the hormones will presumably affect their behavior in much the same way.
In this lab, we attempted to identify unknown hormones by spraying them on growing plants and observing the plant's behavioral response.
It is presumed that by measuring certain variables over time, pre- and post-application, we will be able to see if whether the mystery hormones have inhibitory, stimulatory, or no affect on the growth of the plants.
