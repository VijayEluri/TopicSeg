There are five identified hormones in plants that, in different ways, control the growth of plants.
The hormones, taken from our lab manual, are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are responsible for cell elongation in young shoots and also for establishing apical dominance, a term referring to the suppression of lateral buds while stimulating apical meristems.
Cytokinins stimulate cell division and work with the other hormones to determine growth patterns.
Gibberellins cause stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination while abscisic acid is responsible for inhibiting bud growth.
Finally, ethylene also acts as a growth inhibiter and is also responsible for abscission of leaves, fruit, and flowers.
This very briefly explains the affects of the five identified plant hormones in order to understand what is taking place in our experiment.
 The purpose in this lab is to identify the "unknown" substance being applied to pea seedlings by recording various aspects of plant growth over a two week period.  The areas of plant growth observed and recorded both weeks were total plant height, number of internodes, and average internode length.  Based on the growth characteristics being measured the outcome of the application of the unknown substance will most likely have an inhibiting or stimulating affect on growth.  Knowing this, it is possible to make an accurate prediction of what hormone the unknown is.  The treatment our group used was treatment 2 and it is predicted that this substance will be a growth stimulating hormone. ==========
