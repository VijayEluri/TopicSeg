Plant hormones are chemical substances that affect flowering, aging, root growth, prevention or promotion of stem elongation, and many other conditions.
Very small concentrations of these substances can produce major growth changes.
Auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid, and ethylene are the five major classes of identified plant hormones (Lab Manual, 2004).
Plant hormones are produced in small quantities in one part of the plant and are transported to other parts of the plant where they show responses (Lab Manual, 2004).
The plant hormone auxin is involved in the elongation of stems and in phototropism.
Cytokinin stimulates cell division and determines the course of differentiation.
Gibberellins play a role in controlling stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Abscisic acid suppresses the growth of buds and promotes leaf senescence.
The last hormone, ethylene has a role in stimulating the ripening of fruit (Raven, 2002).
In this experiment, I tested the effects of two treatments using an unknown hormone in two different concentrations on pea plants.
I am recording the change in length of each internode on the plants to determine the rate of growth.
I want to determine what the two treatments are as well as see how the treatments affected the plants.
I will compare the control to two treatments with a high and a low concentration.
To accomplish this objective, I measured the length of the internodes of six pea plants.
Each pea seedling had a specific label, either as control, treatment 1, or treatment 2.
Two plants were used for each treatment and two plants were designated as the control.
Each plant was set under lights and sprayed throughout one week with the specified treatment or water for the control group.
After one week, the length of the internodes was measured.
Since I did not know what plant hormone was used, I was uncertain as to what to predict for the final outcome.
I did not know how the treatments would specifically affect the plants.
I predicted that the high concentrations of treatment 1 and treatment 2 will cause a greater change than the low concentrations of the treatments.
