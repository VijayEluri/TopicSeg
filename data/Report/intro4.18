From the moment, a baby is delivered from its mother's womb, it is apparent that this baby will grow and develop into a healthy human being.
Plant growth and development, on the other hand, exhibit indeterminate growth or plasticity (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
Because plants display plasticity, they can grow under environments that will improve their reproductive success (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
Plants respond, not only to outside conditions, but also to internal, chemical messengers called plant hormones (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
Plant hormones can either stimulate or inhibit physiological processes, depending on which hormones and tissues are involved (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Plant hormones affect cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, flowering, senescence, etc.
(Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
The seven major plant hormones are auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, brassinosteroids, oligasaccharins, ethylene, and abscisic acid (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
The hormones studied in this experiment were auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid.
The purpose of this experiment is to identify which of these hormones were sprayed on pea plants.
Because each hormone affects plants in unique ways, it will be helpful when identifying the unknown hormones at the end of the experiment.
The main naturally occurring auxin, Indole 3-acetic acid, stimulates cell elongation in young shoots and inhibits lateral growth (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
It is produced in the apical meristems of shoots, and is also involved in phototropism, allowing the plants to bend and grow toward light (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Cytokinins, a hormone produced in the apical meristems of roots, stimulate cell division and differentiation (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Cytokinins carry out its processes with auxin to balance apical dominance, because cytokinins stimulate lateral bud growth.
Because cytokinins can be found in roots, lateral branching tends to appear at the bottom of plants where little auxin is present (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
Gibberellins, a hormone produced in the stems and roots, aid plants in stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination (Jensen and Hangarter, 1997).
Cell division and stem elongation are enhanced with the help of auxin (Jensen and Hangarter, 1997).
Another hormone, abscisic acid, inhibits bud and vascular cambium growth (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
They are produced in mature leaves, fruits, and root caps.
Abscisic acid can regulate the opening and closing of stomata, and assist in seed dormancy (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
The only plant hormone found in a gas state is the growth inhibitor, ethylene.
It is known for promoting senescence and is the reason why leaves and fruits fall off trees.
Ethylene and auxin work simultaneously to make sure plants age at a reasonable rate (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
Ethylene controls fruit ripening in plants, as well (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
At the end of the experiment, when the pea seedlings have grown for 2 weeks, the unknown hormones should be identifiable.
If the data shows shoot or stem growth, the hormones are predicted to be auxin and gibberellins.
Any appearances of lateral growth would hint that the applied hormone was cytokinins.
If the data shows little growth, then the hormones would be either abscisic acid or ethylene.
