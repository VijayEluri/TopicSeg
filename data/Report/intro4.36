Although plants are not similar to human organisms in appearance they are however very similar.
Both are responsive to what is going on in their outside environment.
Unlike most human cells, cells in plants have indeterminate growth.
This means the cells are extremely flexible and can turn into anything needed for the plant; whether it be a stem or a flower.
In addition, plant hormones, like human hormones, assist in the regulation of growth and other ways of keeping the organism in homeostasis.
There are five different classes of plant hormones and they include auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins promote the growth of shoots and the main auxin is IAA or Indole 3-acetic acid.
Auxins are also very important in the aspect of apical dominance.
Cytokinins, which are made in growing tissues, stimulate the division of cells and then regulate differentiation.
Cytokinin is in charge of stimulating the growth of the lateral bud.
Gibberellins have a very wide range of effects.
They include stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Bolting is a common effect of giberellin in which plants grow extremely tall, and thin in width.
Absicic acid is produced in the terminal buds and when it is released causes dormancy.
It can be used in a time where the plant is under a time of stress such as a cold period or a dry period.
It allows the stomata to open and close.
Lastly, ethylene is a growth inhibitor and a gas.
It is very important in the process of aging and causes fruit to ripen and leaves to change.
In addition, there are also environmental changes that cause the plant to move and grow in certain manners.
This includes phototropism which causes plants to respond to light and move towards it.
The plant always bends toward the light.
Gravitropism is the growth of the plant towards the sunlight and the roots toward the ground where the nutrients are located.
In addition, Thigmotropism is the response to touch.
It can be seen when a vine wraps around a fence.
In this experiment pea plants were sprayed with certain plant hormones, the purpose was to decide between the two weeks what kind of growth the plants exhibited.
When we sprayed the plants there was no way to predict what inhibitor or hormone was used.
We will only be able to tell what type of hormone it is when we compare from week 1 and week 2.
For example ethylene would inhibit growth so it would be similar in size when the plants were tested again.
Also, there was also an experiment done on the tropisms of marigold seedlings.
Our group chose to put a marigold seeding in a hutch where only half of the plant was exposed to the light.
For this experiment, we thought the plant would bend towards the light (Burpee, Leicht, Price).
