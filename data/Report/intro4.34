Plant growth is the result of plant hormone responses to tropisms.
These tropisms respond to light (phototropism), gravity (gravitropism), and touch (thigmotropism) (Control of Plant Growth 2004).
Tropisms signal a system of balancing hormones to create the correct environmental response.
The main hormones include auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Each hormone causes a different response to the tropisms.
For example, auxin causes apical dominance and cell elongation in shoots (Ross et al. 2003).
Cytokinins balance auxin induced apical dominance and reduce cell elongation while gibberellins cause only internode elongation (Control of Plant Growth 2004).
Auxin, cytokinins, and gibberellins are the only hormones that will be considered for this experiment's unknown hormonal solution since they are the primary sources of hormonal shoot alterations.
The purpose of this lab is to determine the identity of an unknown plant hormone by comparing growth trends.
The environment will be held constant in an effort make the tropism responses consistent for all of the plants.
Thus, the added unknown hormone will be the main cause for plant growth pattern to alterations.
Each of the previously stated hormones would cause a different growth pattern affect, so by comparing the tested response of the plant to the expected hormonal response we will be able to conclude what the unknown hormone must be.
I hypothesize that the unknown hormone will be auxin since auxin causes growth alterations for all the variables tested where as cytokinins and gibberellins do not alter the number of internodes, height of the plant, and the length of the internodes.
