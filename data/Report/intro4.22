This lab is geared towards testing plant hormones and their effect on plant growth.
There are five plant hormones: Auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acids, and ethylene.
Auxins are the hormone responsible for shoot elongation and apical dominance.
Cytokinins, which are made in the roots of the plant, stimulate cell division.
They usually work with other hormones to regulate cell growth.
Gibberellins can regulate the height of a plant.
Too much can cause bolting and too little can cause dwarfism.
It is another hormone that works with auxin and can stimulate stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination.
Abscisic acid is an inhibitory hormone produced in terminal buds.
It inhibits growth of buds and vascular cambium.
This hormone helps plants survive tough environmental conditions.
The last hormone, ethylene, is another growth inhibitor.
It moves through plant cells by diffusion and has a big hand in the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
It is involved in the aging of the plant and is opposed by auxin.
When the auxin levels of the plant decrease, the ethylene levels increase.
All of these hormones and their interactions are responsible for the growth patterns of plants (Burpee, 2004).
In this lab two unknown hormones will be tested on a group of pea plants.
The outcome of the plant growth should be able to determine whether there is a hormone being inhibited or added.
This can be shown by the promotion of growth or the inhibition.
By measuring the internodes and the change in them after the hormones were applied, the growth pattern should show an inhibitor or an added hormone.
