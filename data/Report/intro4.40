Hormones are the regulators of development that are found in all living organisms.
Merriam Websters online dictionary (1) says that a hormone is "a product of living cells that circulates in body fluids or sap and produces a specific effect on the activity of cells remote from its point of origin; especially: one exerting a stimulatory effect on a cellular activity" The hormones that we are studying now in Biology 240W at Penn State are the hormones which affect plant growth.
There are many types of plant hormones but we focus on the five most prominent hormones Auxin, Cytokinin, Gibberelillic acid, Abscisic acid, and Ethylene.
(2) These growth factors affect plants in many different ways.
This experiment asks us to identify unknown hormones after applying high and low concentrations of them to plants and observing the responses over a measured time period.
We will look for and measure differences in new shoot growth and compare them with normal plants that were sprayed only with water.
These data will show that certain shoots will be hindered in growth and others will be caused to grow much more then normal.
For example an overdose of Gibberellin could cause our pea plant to shoot up in growth however an under dose could cause the plant to go into a more dormant stage and not grow at all.
