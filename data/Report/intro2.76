In this lab, pea plants were exposed to an unknown compound at high and low concentrations, so that they might respond to an internal signal generated by that unknown compound.
Therefore, the purpose of this lab was to then determine the identity of that compound based on the effects it had on the pea plants.
The most forward questions generated by this lab are what class of plant hormones does this unknown compound fall under, what effects does it have on the pea plants, and is it an inhibitor or promoter of such effects?
Based on the differences between the control and treated plants, the above questions and identity of the unknown compound are to be answered.
There are five classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins promote shoot growth and inhibit lateral growth, while cytokinins stimulate cell division and lateral bud growth.
Gibberellins are a large class of naturally occurring plant hormones which promote stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Abscisic acid inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium which enables plants to enter a state of dormancy.
Ethylene is a gaseous hormone which inhibits growth that leads to the abscission of leaves, fruits, and flowers2.
