Plants like all organisms grow and develop.
Plants however have a different means of growth.
Plants show indeterminate growth meaning they are not limited by genetics and will continue to grow through out their life.
Growth is important for a plant because unlike many other organisms, plants don't move, instead they adjust their growth to their environment.
Plants utilize several different hormones and chemical messengers to adjust themselves to this changing environment.
The hormones, like animal hormones, are produced in one area and are transported to extremities.
Plant hormones, however, are not produced in a limited number of places and do not have specific targets, instead, they are produced in many different areas of the plant and exert their effects on a variety of tissues.
The place where the hormone is working determines what the hormone will affect.
Cell division, cell expansion, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination, flowering, and senescence are all processes affected by plant hormones.
Five plant hormones have been discovered and have been greatly described and studied.
They consist of auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene each doing several different duties.
Auxins are known to be any chemical substance that promotes elongation, as well as being important for apical dominance, and other functions of the plant.
Cytokinins are hormones that stimulate cell division and regulate differentiation.
Giberellins have a variety of effects including cell elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Abscisic acid is important for inhibiting the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
Ethylene has important functions in the senescence, especially in leaves, flowers, and fruits.
As you now see each hormone has its unique function in assuring that plants adjust to their environment.
At this point some questions might be entering your head.
What if a substance was applied from an outside source that acts like a hormone?
Could understanding these hormones be the key to growing mass amounts of crops to feed the world?
In this lab we continued to search for further understanding of the plant hormones.
We did so by designing and setting up an experiment with pea seedlings to investigate the effects of unknown compounds on plant growth and then identifying the unknown compounds.
In order to examine this, we will measure number of internodes, length of internodes, and total heights of pea plants.
We hope that the application of the different treatments to the plants will affect the plants so we can determine how they were affected, by comparing them to plants that were just given water.
We hypothesize that the control plants will grow normally, and that we will compare the different treatments to them.
We then proposed that the higher concentration of each treatment would affect the plant more then the lower concentration.
We also project that length of the internodes, total height of the plant, and number of internodes will be affected by the different treatments.
We know that whatever is affected will reveal the type of hormone contained in the treatment.
The test population will be all the plants involved in the experiment, a total of 652 plants, though they will all be given different treatments.
The majority of the information was taken from the lab manual.
