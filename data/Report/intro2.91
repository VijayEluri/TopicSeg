Although plants possess the ability to sense and respond to their environment, their immobility forces them to use a different strategy in order to successfully adjust to changing environmental conditions (Lab Manual, 2004).
Plants use growth as their mechanism for environmental accommodations (Lab Manual, 2004).
Plant growth is highly influenced by a combination of external and internal signals.
Plants' internal signals are essentially different chemicals, or hormones, which have the responsibilities of stimulating or inhibiting any number of various growth responses (Lab Manual, 2004).
There are currently five classes of naturally occurring plant hormones, each having significant influence on a number of growth effects on a variety of different tissues.
The five plant hormone classes are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acids, and ethylene (Lab Manual, 2004).
Auxins are usually recognized by their stimulating of shoot growth (Lab Manual, 2004).
Not only does auxin promote stem elongation, but it also suppresses branching in stems.
This stem growth while inhibiting branching is known as apical dominance (Raven, 2002).
Along with shoot growth effects, auxin is also responsible for promoting root branching and inhibiting root elongation, the reverse of its stem effects (Raven, 2002).
Cytokinins are responsible for promotion of cell division and regulating the development of new tissues, or organogenesis (Lab Manual, 2004).
Their relative concentrations with respect to auxins control whether root or shoot organogenesis is necessary.
Gibberellins, like auxins, also promote stem growth as well as seed germination and fruit growth.
Specifically, gibberellins are responsible for internode elongation in the stems (Raven, 2002).
Gibberellins also differentiate themselves from auxin because they stimulate cell division as well as cell elongation; auxins only promote the latter (Lab Manual, 2004).
Abscisic Acids are hormones responsible for the promotion of dormancy in plants (Raven, 2002).
ABA is responsible for the closing of plant's stomata, promoting dormancy of seeds, inhibiting gibberellins' ability to promote seed germination, and inhibiting auxin's ability to promote stem elongation (Raven, 2002).
Ethylene is the only gaseous plant hormone (Lab Manual, 2004).
It is responsible for growth inhibition.
It also promotes many plant responses such as leaf and flower abscission, and fruit ripening.
The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effects of unknown compounds on three areas of plant growth, and ultimately identify the two unknown plant treatments based on growth responses based on what we know about plant hormones.
Possible outcomes would either be a hormonal response in plant growth, or hormonal inhibition resulting in the lack of growth in that area controlled by the inhibited hormone.
Thus, due to the use of unknown compounds, a hypothesis cannot specifically be stated; however, we can hypothesize that overall the plants will respond in some way to the two treatments, and the plants' response will give rise to the determination of whether the unknown compound is a known hormone or a hormone inhibitor.
