Plants surround us and are a vital part of human life producing the oxygen we live on.
They are capable of growing and differentiating throughout their life, a process called indeterminate growth.
Plant hormones are responsible for the growth patterns of plants depending upon site of action, developmental stage of the plant, and concentration of hormone.
There are five major classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene(Bio 240W Lab Manual p.1-3).
Auxins promote elongation of cells in young shoots and suppresses growth in lateral buds resulting in apical dominance.
Cytokinins stimulate lateral bud growth and work in combination with auxins.
Cytokinin is more prevalent in the roots whereas auxin is more active in the apical meristem.
Gibberellins are very similar to auxin but are more involved in promoting internode growth.(Johnson, p.814-820) High doses of gibberellins lead to bolting which is when plants grow very tall and spindly.
Abscisic acid (ABA), produced in the terminal buds, inhibits the growth of buds promoting dormancy and water conservation.
Ethylene is a growth inhibitor leading to abscission and ripening of fruit.
Ethylene counteracts auxins and vice versa(Hauke).
With a basic understanding of plant hormones, we hope to be able to identify the unknown compounds affecting growth in our pea plants by comparing measurements a week apart concerning control plants, plants treated with treatment 1 in both high and low concentrations, as well as plants treated with treatment 2 in both high and low concentrations.
We believe if the results show growth in the internodes it would be a result of gibberellins acting on the pea plants.
Growth in the shoot would be due to auxins and no growth would be a result of the pea plants being treated with ABA or ethylene.
