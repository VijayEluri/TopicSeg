Plants show indeterminate growth, or do not have a determined size.
Within the plant system, there are many hormones at work to regulate the response to the environment and the growth of the plant.
Some of these hormones include auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene.
Auxins are any chemicals that promote growth in the shoot and cytokinins are hormones that stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
Gibberellins have many effects but mainly are responsible for stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination.
Abscisic acid is produced in the terminal buds and promotes dormancy by inhibiting growth of the buds and vascular cambium.
Ethylene is a gaseous growth inhibitor that is responsible for the dropping of fruits and leaves at the end of a growing season.
All of these hormones work together to give balanced growth of the plant.
When one hormone is present in higher concentrations than normal, it changes the growth of a plant.
The purpose of this experiment was to discover what hormones, or inhibitor of hormones was present in an unknown compound sprayed on the plant.
Depending on the hormones that were present, there could be many effects.
The specific aspect that was looked at was whether the growth was inhibited or promoted.
