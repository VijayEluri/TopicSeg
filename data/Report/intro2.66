Plants are unique organisms in that most of them show indeterminate growth and plasticity.
Indeterminate growth is a characteristic in which organisms can "continue to grow and differentiate throughout their lives" (Burpee et al 2004).
Plants also show plasticity, which allows them to alter certain growth patterns in order to increase their reproductive success in certain environmental conditions.
Growth factors, otherwise known as plant hormones, serve as important internal chemical messengers for plants (Burpee et al 2004).
There are five major classes of plant hormones, which are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are synthesized in the apical meristem of shoots and promote shoot growth.
Auxins simultaneously suppress the growth of lateral buds and lateral shoots, which is known as apical dominance (Burpee et al 2004).
Cytokinins stimulate lateral bud growth.
They are synthesized in the roots of a plant and are transported to the aerial part of the plant through the xylem sap (Burpee et al 2004).
Gibberellins are hormones which cause "stem elongation and cell division, fruit growth, and seed germination."
When plants contain large amounts of gibberellins, they grow "very tall and spindly," which is known as bolting.
When plants have low doses of gibberellins, they are "extremely short and squat" (Burpee et al 2004).
Abscisic acid is produced in the terminal buds of a plant and causes inhibition of bud growth and vascular cambium.
As a result, it encourages dormancy in a plant and contributes to the closing of the stomata, and conservation of water for the plant (Burpee et al 2004).
The last major plant hormone is ethylene, which acts as an inhibitor to growth and promotes the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits (Burpee et al 2004).
In this laboratory experiment, the effects of two unknown treatments, at both high and low concentrations, on Pisum sativum have been examined, compared to a control.
The effects of the unknown compounds have been examined, in an attempt to properly identify them.
This has been done by studying their effects on plants one week after administration of the treatments.
One of the treatments was an unknown hormone, while the other was an inhibitor of the unknown hormone.
The hormone and inhibitor being used to treat the plants will be identified by their effects on plant growth.
Since each treatment was tested with a high and low concentration, and there was a control, the growth responses of the plants to the unknown compounds should be an identifier of what the hormone and inhibitor are.
