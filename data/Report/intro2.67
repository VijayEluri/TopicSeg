Much like humans, plants use hormones to regulate growth, function, and development in response to environmental stimuli.
Due to the indeterminate growth of plants, they must continually be able to sense and react to these stimuli in order to continually grow and differentiate as long as they are alive.
Commonly, plant hormones are used to relay these responses internally throughout the plant.
These hormones can be released in small quantities in one location of the plant and elicit an amplified response to a variety of locations near and far from where they originated.
These hormones can also have different effects depending upon what location of the plant it interacts.
A hormone may be secreted in the leaves, and induce two completely different response in the stems and the roots.
These hormones often interact, and depending on the concentration gradient of one plant over the other, they will elicit a specific response.
Among the most well known plant hormones auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins, synthesized in the apical meristem, are known to enhance stem elongation and reduce branching (known as apical dominance), while in the roots, it suppresses growth and stimulates branching.
Cytokinins are synthesized in the roots and promote bud elongation.
Auxins and cytokinins often work in concert to regulate plant growth.
Gibberellins have a variety of influences, but are well known to strongly effect stem cell division and elongation.
High doses promote rapid vertical growth causing the plant to be very thin (Bolting).
Abscisic acid, produced in the terminal bud is known to promote dormancy under extreme environmental factors.
Ethylene promotes the aging and ripening of plants and fruits, which can be counteracted by auxins (Campbell 2002).
This experiment is meant to determine the effects of high and low concentrations of two unknown treatments on one hormone in pea plants.
We will make measurements of total plant length, internode length, and number of internodes both before then one week after the hormone is applied.
After comparing these measurements through the percent difference in plant growth, we will make a suggestion of what hormone the two treatments applied are affecting.
The purpose of this lab is to identify these unknown treatments.
I propose that this experiment will show that each treatment will either hinder of promote shoot growth and/or branching since that is the variable we are testing.
I propose that there will also be increased affects on plant growth with increasing concentration of treatment.
