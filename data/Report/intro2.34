This lab examines how plants grow and develop in response to the environment.
Stimuli from the surroundings and internal regulators control and influence the growth of the plant.
Plant hormones or growth factors are examples of internal signals that can help regulate plant growth.
There are five main classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene (Burpee, 2004).
These plant hormones all have specific effects, including promotions and inhibitions.
Auxins promote shoot growth and lateral root suppression.
Cytokinins control cell division and differentiation.
Giberellins are involved in shoot growth and seed production.
Abscisic acid inhibits bud growth.
Ethylene is a gas that inhibits growth and controls the aging process of the plant and fruits (Burpee, 2004).
The plant hormones are influenced by cues from the environment.
These environmental cues and responses can be witnessed by studying tropisms.
Tropisms describe the response of plants to particular external stimuli.
For example, gravitropism occurs due to the effect of gravity.
The roots grow downwards towards water and minerals, and the shoots and leaves grow upwards towards sunlight.
Thigmotropism is a plant growth response to touch and mechanical stimulation.
Phototropism is a response to light that influences shoot growth towards the light.
(Burpee, 2004.)
This lab sought to gain first hand experience with the tropisms and plant growth responses to different hormones.
Two different experiments were performed.
One involved observing tropisms in marigold plants.
The data will support the expected effects of gravitropism, thigmotropism, and phototropism on the plants.
The other experiment involved applying unknown plant hormones to pea plants and then analytically recording the results.
The results obtained from the plants will allow the unknown plant hormone applied to be deduced by which effect was witnessed.
This data will show that the plants are controlled by the surrounding environment, and that they alter their growth patterns according to different cues or hormones.
