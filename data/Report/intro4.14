Plants have the ability to respond to their environment and show indeterminate growth.
When hormones are introduced to a plant, it will respond accordingly.
Four categories of hormones, auxins, cytokinins, gibberelins, and ethylene, have different effects on plant growth.
Auxins causes elongation of the shoots in plants1.
Auxins also stimulate cell elongation, delay leaf senescence, and delay leaf rippening2.
Auxins suppress the growth of lateral buds creating apical dominance1.
This is caused by the phototropic response of plants to grow towards the light1.
Cytokinins are hormones that, when applied to a plant, will stimulate cell division and regulate to pathway of differentiation1.
Cytokinins stimulate the growth of lateral buds, thus inhibiting apical dominance2.
These hormones stimulate chlorophyll production and may enhance the stomatal opening in some plants2.
Cytokinins are actively produced in tissue cultures, developing fruits and roots1.
Gibberelins, or gibberelic acid are naturally occurring plant hormones1.
This class of hormones stimulated cell division, and can result in a phenomenon known as bolting, or rapid growth of the shoot2.
These hormones can also cause seedless fruits to develop in some plants2.
Ethylene is a gaseous growth inhibitor1.
This hormone stimulates flowering, and general aging of a plant. when used in conjunction with auxins (which tend to counteract the effects of ethylene), and plant growth can be controlled.
As Ethylene levels in a plant increase, fruits and leaves will drop1.
This hormone is responsible for the leaf dropping season we know as the Fall.
In this experiment, six pea plants were tested.
Two were the control, and the other four were exposed to either a high, or low concentration of an unknown hormone. measurements were taken on total height of the plants, number of internodes of a plant, and the average length of each internode.
From these data, the hormones the plants were exposed to can be determined.
