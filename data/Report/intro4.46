Plants, like humans, have developed many adaptations to their environments.
When a plant is restricted from sunlight it must develop a physical response in order to better attain sunlight needed for survival.
Hormones or growth factors are the primary force behind the plants adaptation for light.
Hormones control plant growth through cell division, elongation and differentiation.
Five hormones or growth factors have been identified; auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
When light directs the growth of the plant this is a process called phototropism.
Many experiments were performed to discover what the mechanism was that allowed the shoots of plants to bend toward sunlight.
The result of these experiments was the discovery of the hormone, auxin.
Only the tip of the coleoptile is capable of sensing light; when there is a deficiency in light, the coleoptile will sense and bend towards the light.
Auxin is the hormone responsible for the coleoptile's bending response.
The side of the shoot that is exposed to darkness receives a higher amount of auxin causing that side to elongate faster and receive the exposure to light which it needs.
Phototropism is just one example of a process that controls the growth of a plant.
Physical exposure of a plant to a specific concentration of a hormone could produce an inhibition or stimulation of growth in a plant.
The role of hormone is quite different between plants and humans.
In humans, hormones are produce in one area of the body and sent to a target tissue or organ.
Plants, however, produce hormones in numerous areas and are sent to an array of areas (Price et.al, 2004).
When a plant is therefore exposed to one specific hormone, the effect may not be as clear cut due to the fact that a hormone must interact with already present concentrations of other hormones within the plant.
"The response to a hormone usually depends not so much on the absolute amount of a hormone as on its relative concentration compared with other hormones" (Campbell et. al, 2002).
Both auxin and gibberellin affect stem elongation in different concentrations.
When observing a plant for growth it can be hypothesized that the hormones auxin and gibberellin would be the two unknown compounds applied to the pea plant.
