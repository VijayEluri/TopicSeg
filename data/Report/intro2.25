Animals are not the only organisms to use hormones; plants produce and use hormones that, like animals, regulate many aspects of growth, development, and functions of life.
The five major types of plant hormones include auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
These hormones allow plants to respond to the environment; this type of response is called a tropism.
For example, auxin causes cell elongation on a side of a plant that is not exposed to light.
This in turn, causes the plant to bent toward the light.
A plant's response to light is called phototropism.
Other tropisms include gravitropism (response to gravity) and thigmotropism (response to touch) (Cyr 1994).
For this lab, two unknown substances were sprayed on pea plants in order to see what effect hormones have on plants.
The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of unknown compounds on plant growth and then to identify the unknown compounds.
Questions addressed were how much did a plant grow after the application of a compound, did the plant grow more or less than the control group, and if so why.
It is hypothesized that these data will show that one of the compounds used was auxin and that the other compound was an auxin inhibitor.
By studying the effects of how plant growth can be manipulated through hormone application and hormone inhibition, one can experience how the growth of some plants is manipulated for agricultural and industrial purposes.
