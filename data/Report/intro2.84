One property that defines an object as being a living organism is its ability to grow and develop.
As Earth's primary producers, many plants not only increase in size, but also grow indeterminately in which a number of chemical pathways determine the rate and endpoint of cell division.
These chemicals, known as hormones, play a key role in maintaining homeostasis in all life processes.
Each hormone has a multiplicity of effects, depending upon the site of action, development stage of the plant, and concentration of the hormone (Cyr).
At the same time, growth inhibitors, which are chemicals that halt plant enlargement, are also present, leading to an ever-changing display of conflict with hormones.
Partaking in studying the effects of plant hormones and inhibitors, procedures from Cyr and Paradise's Control of Plant Growth: Plant Hormones and Tropisms were followed.
In this experiment, two different unknown chemical treatments were applied to pea plants, both in high and low concentrations.
The purpose of this experiment is to categorize each treatment as being a hormone or inhibitor while also studying the effects hormones and inhibitors have on total plant height, number of internodes, and lengths of internodes.
In general, a number of questions arise prior to such experimentation.
Although it is predicted that a plant will increase in overall height when treated with a hormone, it is uncertain if the number of internodes will increase or whether the original internodes will simply just increase in length, leading to the growth of the pea plant.
It is hypothesized that the plants treated with the hormone agent will exhibit a greater increase in overall plant height and internode length than the untreated control plants.
The number of new internodes should also be greater in the hormone treated plants than in the untreated plants.
At the same time, it is predicted that the plants treated with the inhibitor agent will exhibit a less significant increase in total height and internode length than the control plants.
The inhibitor agent should also reduce the growth of new internodes to a level that is below that of the number of new internodes in untreated plants.
