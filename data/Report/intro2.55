Plants and animals are very similar in a variety of ways.
For example, plants sense and respond to their environments like animals.
The response elicited by plants is generally an alteration in growth or development.
Most plants we study exhibit indeterminate growth; the continual growth and differentiation throughout the plants lifetime.
Growth and differentiation are highly dependent upon environmental constraints.
For example, plants will optimize growth during favorable climate, temperature, lighting, and while water is abundant.
"A plant's morphology and physiology are tuned to their surroundings by an interaction of environmental cues and internal signals" (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Similarly to animals, plants also produce hormones which regulate their growth and development.
However, plant hormones are not tissue specific such as those of animals.
In addition, these hormones can be produced in a variety of locations within the plant, unlike animals in which hormones are produced at a discrete location.
Plant hormones have a multiplicity of effects on the plant itself, depending on the hormone concentration, stage of growth, and the target site of the hormone.
Cell division, enlargement, differentiation; polarity of growth, pattern of branching, flowering, seed germination and senescence are factors all dependent on plant hormones.
There are five major classes of plant hormones; auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins promote shoot growth and gives rise to apical dominance; suppression of lateral buds with emphasis on lateral growth (responsible for the triangular shape of trees).
Cytokinins regulate cell division and overall differentiation of tissues.
Cytokinin balance with auxin is highly dependent upon apical dominance.
Gibberellins effects stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination.
Abundance of this hormone is responsible for very tall and spindly trees, known as bolting.
Abscisic acid inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
In addition, this hormone closes the plant's stomata during drought.
Ethylene is a unique hormone mainly because it is a gaseous compound which diffuses freely among plant cells.
Ethylene acts to inhibit plant growth as aging occurs (senescence).
It is now essential to investigate the environmental cues or hormonal signals in which plants respond to.
These are known as tropisms or plants hormonal responses to environmental cues.
Phototropism is a response to the unidirectional light source.
Gravitropism is responsible for the upward growth of shoots (negative gravitropism); and the downward growth of roots (positive gravitropism).
Finally, thigmotroism is directional growth in response to touch (plants will grow around obstacles).
Within this laboratory exercise, we will investigate the effects of tropisms and different plant hormones.
In addition, we will design an experiment further investigating these concepts.
I hypothesize that phototropism will predominate over gravitopism, thus plants will grow towards the direction of light, despite its relationship to the ground (see next section for experimental design).
Furthermore, I hypothesize that in experiment two, low concentrations of treatment one will result in inhibited plant growth.
