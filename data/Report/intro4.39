Plants and animals alike must be able to get cues from the environment and respond to them.
They must be able to respond to light, water, growth levels, and a host of other things.
Once a signal is received from the environment, chemical messengers known as plant hormones help in relaying the message (Penn State 2004).
Plant hormones affect nearly every aspect of a plants life and growth.
For instance, hormones are involved in seed germination, cell division and enlargement, flowering, fruiting, and aging.
Plant hormones are separated into five major classes: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxin is involved in elongation of the coleoptiles.
Cytokinins regulate the cell differentiation pathway and promote cell division.
Gibberellins are involved in fruit growth, stem elongation, and seed germination.
Abscisic acid is active in terminal buds, inhibiting their growth as well as the vascular cambium.
Ethylene is a growth inhibitor.
It is involved in the abscission of leaves, flowers and fruits.
Ethylene is counteracted by auxin (Penn State, 2004).
In this lab, two unknown treatments will be used on pea seedlings.
By analyzing the effects of these treatments, we will attempt a guess at which of the five classes of hormones are represented by the treatments.
If one of the treatments is an auxin, we would expect to see extended shoot growth in those seedlings, and decreased shoot growth by those treated with its inhibitor.
If a treatment is a gibberellin, we will expect the treated plants to grow taller and more spindly than normal.
This is commonly called bolting.
The gibberellin inhibitor would cause small or dwarfed plants.
If the treatment was an ethylene we would see smaller plants that are senescing at a faster rate than normal.
It is unlikely to be a cytokinin because this hormone is seen mainly in embryos, fruits and roots.
We will only be looking at the shoots of seedlings.
It is also unlikely to be abscisic acid because this hormone is mainly active in terminal buds during periods of environmental stress (Penn State, 2004).
Since our study focuses mainly on growth patterns and stem elongation, the most likely culprits for the unknown compounds are gibberellin, auxin, or ethylene.
We also expect to see a difference by what concentration of treatment is used.
Logically, high concentrations will have a more exaggerated effect than low concentrations.
By examining the growth or these seedlings, the data should provide insight to which class of hormones is present.
