As plants grow, their physical appearance is modified by the environmental conditions that they experience.
Somehow the rates of growth and differentiation of cells in different parts of the plant are coordinated in response to these inputs.
In order to change according to environmental conditions there has to be some kind of communication between these levels.
There is some way that plants receive and respond to environmental signals and adjust growth and development according to the environment.
This implies that there are certain factors that regulate the growth of plants.
These are known as plant hormones.
Plant hormones work in very small concentrations, affecting membrane properties, controlling gene expression and affecting enzyme activity.
There are five different types of hormones each of which have different functions with respect to plant growth.
These are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene.
Compounds are generally considered auxins if they can be characterized by their ability to induce cell elongation in stems and otherwise resemble indoleacetic acid.Auxin stimulates the production of secondary growth by simulating cambium cells to divide and secondary xylem to differentiate.
Auxin produced in apical buds tends to inhibit the activation of buds lower on the stems.
This is known as apical dominance.
This effect lessens with distance from the shoot tip [1].
Cytokinins counter the apical dominance effect of auxin Auxins also Promote lateral and adventitious root development, promotes other hormone production, especially ethylene when auxin concentration increases and also promotes flower initiation.
Loss of auxin initiates leaf abscission.
Cytokinins are compounds with a structure resembling adenine which promote cell division Cytokinins promote cytokinesis.
They are found primarily in root meristems, embryos and fruits, and migrate from roots to the shoot systems of plants in xylem tissue Cytokinins can promote auxiliary bud growth by over-riding the apparent inhibiting effect of auxin.
This is one of the ways in which plants balance root and shoot growth.
Shoot tip auxins inhibit lateral bud activation.
Cytokinins produced in root meristems travel upward in xylem and if in higher concentration counter the inhibition of auxins to activate lateral buds
Gibberellins are produced in roots and younger leaves.
Most effects of gibberellins are shown only in concert with auxins.
Gibberellins work with auxins to promote rapid elongation and division of stem tissue.
It is thought that gibberellins particularly promote expansin activity.
This is seen in Bolting of biennials and Reversal of genetic dwarfism.
Gibberellins promote flowering in biennials during the first growing season, this process is called bolting.
Gibberellins are important to breaking dormancy after inhibition of water by the seed coat Gibberellins also stimulate some fruit enlargement (e.g., grapes with longer internodes).It can also delay senescence in leaves and citrus fruits [1].
Abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone that functions by inhibiting growth activities in times of environmental stress rather than by promoting growth.
It often serves as an antagonist to the other growth promoting hormones in plants.
ABA promotes seed dormancy activities [2].
ABA levels are high when seeds mature, promoting lowered metabolism and synthesis of proteins needed to withstand the dehydration associated with dormancy.
Seeds germinate when ABA is degraded by some environmental action.
Low levels of ABA in maturing seeds promote premature germination.
It also inhibits shoot growth but will not have as much affect on roots.
It induces seeds to synthesize storage proteins and has some effect on induction and maintenance of dormancy.
It also induces gene transcription especially for proteinase inhibitors in response to wounding which may explain an apparent role in pathogen defense.
Ethylene is the sole growth regulator known, which is a gas.
Ethylene is produced in many plant organs.
Ethylene affects many aspects of growth and development in tissues throughout the plant, but emphasis is on fruit maturation, leaf abscission and senescence.
Ethylene has the following functions: Stimulates the release of dormancy.
Ethylene stimulates shoot and root growth and differentiation and may have a role in adventitious root formation [2].
It stimulates leaf and fruit abscission and flower and leaf senescence.
Ethylene also stimulates fruit ripening.
Plant growth is also affected by the external environment.
This directional growth of a plant or part of a plant, in response to an external stimulus such as gravity light, or touch is known as tropism.
The different types of tropisms include phototropism, thigmotropism and gravitropism.
This report is the out come of a study which shows the effect of different unknown compounds in two concentrations on plants.
For this study we were given a pea plant and were made to test the effects of these unknown compounds on the pea seedlings growth.
The main purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effect on plants as well as identify these unknown compounds, which comprises the hypothesis of this experiment.
One of the main issues dealt with in this experiment, is whether plant hormones affect tropic responses.
The outcome of this experiment went according to our hypothesis, that is, that these unknown compounds affected the growth of the plant.
In order to go about this, different kinds of data were presented to us.
The data included the type of treatment used, that is treatment 1 or treatment 2 each having two levels of concentration that is high or low, plant number, total plant height for week 1 and week2, average internode length for week 1 and week two and finally total number of internodes for week 1 and week 2.This data will show us how each of these treatments affected the plant and with this information we will be able to figure out what the unknown compounds are.
A compound that will affect the growth of a plant could be a hormone, either one that promotes growth or one that inhibits it.
The experiment was divided into two weeks where in all the variables for both the weeks are tabulated and compared to start the analysis.
