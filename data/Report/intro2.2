The growth of plants contrasts starkly with human and animal growth.
Animals have genetic programming that determines how large they will become, and once they reach that point, growth ceases.
If an animal loses a limb or other part of its body, that part will be permanently lost because it cannot and will not grow back.
This is called determinate growth.
Plants, on the other hand, undergo indeterminate growth (Burpee et al, 2004).
Plants have no genetically predefined limits to their growth, and they can regenerate new organs from those that have been lost.
Plant growth is largely influenced by hormones (Burpee et al, 2004).
In animals, hormones regulate many of the body's processes, such as growth, development, respiration, and water uptake/output (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Plant hormones have these same functions, and they flow through the plants' vascular systems just like through animal vascular systems.
Several different classes of hormones were studied in this experiment.
Auxins promote shoot growth, inhibit lateral branching, and cause phototropism (Burpee et al, 2004).
Cytokinins stimulate cell division and work with auxins to determine plant development (Burpee et al, 2004).
Gibberellins stimulate cell division and stem elongation (Burpee et al, 2004).
Abscisic acid helps plants deal with drought conditions by closing stomata and inhibiting growth (Burpee et al, 2004).
Finally, ethylene is a gaseous hormone that inhibits growth and causes leaves to fall and fruit to ripen (Burpee et al, 2004).
These hormones help guide plant growth through certain environmental factors in a way that maximizes the survival of the plant.
For example, plants tend to grow toward light, a phenomena known as phototropism.
This involves auxin causing one side of the shoot to grow faster than the other, maximizing light absorption (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
In addition to detecting light, plants can detect gravity and grow either with it or against it, which is called gravitropism.
Typically, plant roots grow in the direction of gravity and shoots grow opposite to gravity (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
In thigmotropism, plants can detect touch and grow around objects like vines do (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Each of these three tropisms shows plants' ability to detect and respond to various factors that affect their ability to maximize survival.
The purpose of this lab was to examine pea plant growth when treated with unknown hormones and to determine which hormones were used based on the plant measurements and our knowledge of the effects of various hormones.
Another purpose of this lab was to investigate the effects of tropisms on plant growth by examining marigold shoot angle over time.
Our group investigated thigmotropism using wind from a fan.
I believe these data will show that the hormone treated plants will grow at a different rate than the control plants, either showing an overall percent increase or decrease in total height, internode average length, and internode number.
The data should also show that the low concentration treatments will have a less drastic effect on growth than the high concentration treatments.
The plant in the thigmotropism experiment should be shorter and thicker than the control so that it can withstand the force of wind.
