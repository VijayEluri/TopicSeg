Plants growth can be controlled by many different things including tropisms and hormones.
Each tropism and hormone affects the plants in different ways.
There are three types of tropisms including phototropism, gravitropism, thigmotropism, and hydrotropism.
Hormones also have a great impact on the growth of plants.
Tropisms are "the growth responses of plants to environmental cues (or other external stimuli)".
The first type of tropism is phototropism.
Phototropism is the plants response to light.
Because plants have to constantly make their own food, the must find supplies of energy.
The sun is an abundant source of the energy that plants need to photosynthesize, although other light sources can also be used.
Plants must grow towards light and have the leaves arranged in a manner for sufficient light intake.
Phototropism is when plants undergo growth or movement towards light (1).
A second kind of tropism is gravitropism.
Gravitropism is simply a plants response to gravity.
The roots respond to gravity by growing down farther into the soil and the shoots respond to gravity by growing up.
The growth down through soil exhibited by plants is called positive gravitropism and its main purpose is to locate water and minerals.
The growth of shoots upward is called negative gravitropism and is another tropism that involves growth towards a light source (1).
The next tropism is thigmotropism.
Thigmotropism is a growth response to touch or mechanical stimulation.
Some plants display growth towards touch, while others display growth away from touch.
Plants like vines, for example, want to grow towards touch so that they can climb up.
Most other plants grow away from touch like strong wind by growing in the opposite direction and becoming thicker for stability.
The last tropism which is not explored in this lab is hydrotropism, or the growth of plants (particularly roots) towards water sources (1).
There are five main categories of hormones including auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Hormones are responsible for tropisms, cell division, growth, and response.
One of the most important types of hormones is auxins.
Auxins are responsible for promoting growth in shoots and inhibiting growth in roots.
Auxin is responsible for phototropism in shoots.
If a light source comes from the side, auxin promotes shoot elongation on the side opposite of the light.
Auxins also assist in apical dominance, activation of vascular cambium, and root branching.
Cytokinins are another major group of plant hormones.
Its main role is cell division, organogenesis, and apical dominance.
The next types of hormones are gibberellins.
Gibberellins actions include seed germination, internode elongation, and floral development.
Abscisic acid has many roles including stomatal function (the opening and closing of stomatas), the maturation of seeds, the dormancy of seeds, and also help to inhibit some other hormones.
The last category of hormones is ethylene.
Ethylene's main functions include helping fruit ripen, inhibiting bud growth, inhibiting flowering, the generation of air spaces in roots during water logging, and the abscission (falling off) of leaves.
All of these hormones are extremely important and have a great affect on plants (1).
The purpose of this lab is to investigate the effects of certain tropisms and hormones.
Observing what affects different tropisms and different hormones have on plants may help us conclude the true effects they have on the plant.
We want to find whether tropisms or hormones promote or inhibit certain things in plants.
For example, using a unidirectional light, will a plant actually grow towards the light?
There are very many important facts to uncover about the affects of tropisms and hormones.
If we test plants with different tropisms and different hormones, then we will find that the plants are either inhibited or promoted by these factors.
