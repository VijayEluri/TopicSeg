Plant hormones are chemicals contained within plants and, among other effects, control plant growth and development.
Five major hormones have been discovered and include auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene (Cyr, 2004).
Auxins are chemicals that stimulate the growth of stems and internodes and inhibit the growth of roots.
Cytokinins promote cell division and organogenesis (Cyr, 2004).
Gibberellins promote germination of seeds, elongation of internodes, and floral development.
Abscisic acid stimulates plants to take action to prevent water loss.
Ethylene has a role in ripening of fruit, inhibits bud growth and flowering, and causes leaves to fall off of the trees (Cyr, 2004).
This experiment addressed a variety of questions.
The first question was what effect different hormones and chemicals have on pea seedlings.
Another question was whether different concentrations of specific hormones had different effects on the growth and development of pea seedlings.
Yet another question that was addressed was whether the hormones caused any significant difference in growth of the pea plants when compared to the control plants.
The purpose of this experiment was to design an experiment to determine what the identity of an unknown chemical was based on the effects it had on pea seedlings.
The outcome of this experiment will show that the two treatments used will have an effect on the growth and development of the pea seedlings.
It is expected that the higher concentration of the treatment will result in a greater effect on the pea seedlings.
Also, the data will show that the treated plants will have a greater percent difference in growth of the pea seedlings than in the growth of the control plants.
