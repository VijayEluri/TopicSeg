Plant morphology and physiology is regulated, in part by chemical messengers called plant hormones.
These growth regulating hormones include: Auxins, Cytokins, Gibberllins, abscisic acids and ethylene.
Each hormone effects growth differently.
Some hormones can stimulate or inhibit growth, in combinations of two or more, and may counter the effects of another hormone (Raven 813).
The purposes of this experiment is examine the effects of two liquids, determine if these substances have positive or negative affects on plant growth and predict which plant hormones are in each substance.
To achieve the goals for the experiment we treated pea seedlings with each unknown substance at a high and low level of concentration.
A measurable change in plant growth should be present if the substances contain plant hormones.
The predicted results are that hormones are present and will have positive effects on growth in the pea seedlings.
