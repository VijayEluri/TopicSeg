Tropisms, not many people recognize the word, but a majority of the people has, unknowingly, observed what they are.
For instance, what happens when you put a plant in a room with only a single light source?
The plant will grow towards that light in order to maximize its photosynthetic capability.
Also, nearly everybody has seen ivy creeping up the side of a building.
These are both examples of plant tropisms.
Tropisms are defined as the growth responses of plants to environmental stimuli1.
In other words, it is what the plant will do when it encounters a change in its surroundings.
There are three main tropisms in plants: phototropism, gravitropism, and thigmotropism2.
Phototropism is what is observed when a plant is placed in a dark room with only a single light source.
It is the reaction of plants to light.
Gravitropism is the reaction of plants to gravity.
If a plant is placed upside down, the plant recognizes this and its shoots begin to grow back towards the sky and the roots begin to grow back down into the Earth.
The ivy on the building is an example of thigmotropism.
Thigmotropism is the plant's response to touch.
How do tropisms work?
Plants obviously do not have eyes to see light or a nervous system to tell them when they are touching something, so how does it know?
The answer is hormones.
Plants hormones are what cause the different changes in plants when they encounter different stimuli.
There are five different classes of hormones in plants, auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene2.
The concentration levels of these five hormone groups are what cause certain responses in plants.
Auxins are hormones the cause cell elongation in plants.
They are processed in the apical meristem.
Auxins promote the lateral growth of roots and suppress the growth of lateral shoots, which results in the phenomenon of apical dominance.
The auxin concentration is highest near the apical meristem and lowest near the trunk of the tree.
Therefore, the top of the tree has very few lateral shoots and the base of the tree has more.
This is why a Christmas tree looks like a cone.
Cytokinins are formed in the roots and they suppress lateral root growth and promote lateral shoot growth.
Gibberellins have a direct affect on stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination1.
Abscisic acid is a hormone that promotes dormancy by inhibiting the growth of terminal buds and vascular cambium.
Ethylene is a gaseous hormone and its most noticeable affect on plants is the ripening of fruit.
It also has an affect on the abscission of leaves and fruit.
So what would happen if some of these hormones were to be sprayed on different plants?
The results of the experiment will hopefully provide an answer to this question.
If the plant grows taller, does that mean that auxin was applied?
Conversely, if the plant does not grow at all, does that mean that abscisic acid was applied and caused the plant to go into a state of dormancy?
If Ethylene were administered to the plant, would all of the leaves fall off of the plant?
All of these are valid questions that can be addressed after analyzing the data.
