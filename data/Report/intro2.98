As most already know, that since plants are rooted to a particular location for their entire existence they must respond to environmental cues by alternating their patterns of growth and development.
Most plants have the property of indeterminate growth which means they can continue to grow and differentiate throughout their lives.
Among the most important things of plant growth is internal signals created by small chemical messengers known as plant hormones.
Plant hormones are different from animal hormones because they can exert their effects on a variety of different tissues regardless of their origin.
Most hormones have a multiplicity of effects that depend on the site of action, developmental stage of the plant and the concentration of the hormone.
There are five major classes of hormones that have been identified.
These hormones are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are any chemical substance that promotes elongation of coleoptiles, more commonly known as shoot growth.
The hormone class of cytokinins are hormones that both stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
They are chemically related to the nucleotide adenine.
Cytokinins are produced in actively growing tissues and then are synthesized in the roots and move to their targets in the aerial part of the plant by way of the xylem sap.
Normally, cytokinins work in conjunction with auxins and other hormones to regulate growth patterns.
One main thing is roots and shoots can be determined by the amount of cytokinins.
The gibberellins are naturally occurring plant hormones.
They have a variety of effects on plant growth including stem elongation, fruit growth and seed germination, most notable is the effect on stem elongation.
Abscisic acid is produced in the terminal buds, and inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambrium.
Abscisic acid deals mostly with water retention.
Ethylene is a simple gaseous compound that diffuses through the air spaces between plant cells and acts as a growth inhibitor.
This experiment was created to test different unknown chemicals on the growth pattern off the plant.
The information in the following pages should better explain the experiment and also identify the unknown hormones the plants were subjected to.
