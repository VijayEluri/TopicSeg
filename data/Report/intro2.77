For motile organisms, a change in the environment may not have a large effect.
If a problem arises, these organisms can just move to a different location.
However, plants are sessile, which means there are more or less stationary.
As a result they have developed very sophisticated ways of dealing with changes in light, temperature, soil acidity and salinity, and water availability (Ferguson, 2003).
Plants would not be able to survive unless they can respond to their environment.
One example of how plants respond was seen in our study of tropisms.
A marigold plant was laid on its side and allowed to grow, and within 3 days the stem made a 45-degree angle so the plant was growing upright with respect to the earth.
This is known as negative gravitropism, and many other types of tropism can be observed (Burpee, et al, 2004).
Another way plants respond to their environment is with internal signals, plant hormones.
There are five major classes of hormones in plants.
First are the auxins, which cause apical dominance and shoot growth.
There are also the cytokinins, which determine growth rate patterns.
The gibberellins, or gibberellic acid, effect fruit growth, seed germination, and stem elongation.
Abscisic acid can induce dormancy in plants and seeds.
Finally, ethylene is a gaseous hormone that inhibits growth and causes fruit ripening and abscission (Burpee, et. al, 2004).
In this lab, pea plants were either kept in a control group where they were treated with water, or given doses of an unknown hormone treatment.
There were two different treatments, each at two concentrations, low and high.
The treatments are named T1L, T1H, T2L, OR T2H based on the treatment and the concentration.
Our hypothesis is that the treatment will affect growth.
Based on the aforementioned knowledge of what these hormones do, by observing plant growth patterns the unknown hormones can be identified.
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between the control and experimental groups.
