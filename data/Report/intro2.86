Since plants are gifted with indeterminate growth, they are able to continue growing through most of their lives while adjusting growth patterns to optimize reproductive success.
In order to efficiently adjust their growth patterns, plants require hormones that can relatively quickly make drastic changes in the organism's growth.
Within plants, there are five major varieties of these hormones: Auxin, Cytokinins, Gibberellins, Ethylene, and Abscisic acid.
Each of these hormones plays a different role in the plant's life cycle.
Auxin, perhaps the most major plant hormone, promotes stem elongation in growing plants while suppressing the growth of lateral buds, resulting in a trend known as apical dominance (Lab Book).
Cytokinins are responsible for promotion of chloroplast development and delaying leaf aging.
Next, Gibberellins like Auxins, are responsible for stem elongation but to a lesser extent than Auxin.
Ethlyene is the hormone responsible for the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits from plants.
It is excreted from the plant as a gas and causes the ripening of the producing fruit and any near by.
Finally, Abscisic acid is the hormone that causes responses due to drought.
It inhibits bud growth, causes stomatal closure and inhibits the effects of the other hormones (Lab Book).
Due to the varying effects of each of these hormones, one could determine what hormones were at work as a plant grows.
For example, when a plant is placed near a sunny window the plant will seem as though it is growing towards the light.
In reality the plant is elongating on the side opposite the sun, causing it to bend in the direction of the light.
Since this is a major growth of part of the stem, we can attribute this phototropism to Auxins.
In order to determine the identity of an unknown hormone, bean plants germinated and grown under identical conditions will be separated into six groups, two groups of control plants; two groups with be treated with hormone 1, one group at a high concentration and one at a low; and the final two groups will receive treatment with hormone 2, one group at a high concentration and one at a low.
These plants will be measured for total height, number of internodes, and average length of the internodes.
The data from this experiment will show that the hormones in question were Auxin and Ethylene gas respectively.
