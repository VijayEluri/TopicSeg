The purpose of this experiment is to determine the identity of two unknown chemical compounds by investigating their effects on internode elongation and leaf formation (nodes) in young pea seedlings.
Two different unknown chemical compounds will be applied to the pea seedlings and their effects (in comparison to control plants) will be observed.
Each chemical compound will be tested in a high concentration solution and a low concentration solution.
The main question that will be raised is how these chemical compounds effect plant development, with regards to their effects on the three variables of plant height, number of internodes (space between leaf formation), and the length of internodes (Bio 240W Lab Manual, 2004).
By analyzing these effects, and comparing them to published literature, the identity of the compounds should be able to be deduced.
Naturally, plant hormones work together in plants to induce (or inhibit) different responses such as cell division, cell elongation, flower formation, etc.
Basically, all plant growth (or lack of) is controlled by hormones.
Because of this, it is reasonable to conclude that at least one of the unknown chemical compounds is a plant hormone.
The other may be a plant hormone, or it could be an inhibitor of a plant hormone.
(Campbell et al. 1999)
To hypothesize what the unknown compounds could be, it was first necessary to take a look at some of the rough data to obtain a general idea of what they could be.
It seems that the first hormone for both concentrations (T1H and T1L) increased the percent changes of internode length, total plant height, and the number of internodes as compared to the control treatment.
The second hormone, for both concentrations (T2L and T2H) seemed to decrease the percent change of all three variables as compared to the control treatment.
For determining what the unknown chemical compounds are, it is only necessary to look for a hormone that increases (or decreases) the rate of node formation (which directly effects the number of internodes) and has the same effect (increasing or decreasing) on the length of internodes.
Total plant height does not need to be analyzed with regards to chemical compound determination because if both the number of internodes and internodes elongation increases simultaneously, then naturally, plant height will increase and visa versa.
After some preliminary investigation, it was found that both gibberellin and auxin are responsible for increased cell elongation in the shoot systems of plants. gibberellin promotes cell elongation by changing the Cortical Microtubule Orientation in the cortex of the plant cell.
This microtubule array secretes an enzyme in an oriented fashion that catalyzes the creation of the cell wall (with the same orientation as the microtubule array).
The cell wall orientation is crucial in permitting the axial elongation of cells.
(Wenzel et. al.
2000) Auxin induces cell elongation because of the acid growth hypothesis where it adds protons to the cell wall, which weakens them and allows for the cell to be expanded by increasing its internal turgor pressure.
(Campbell et al.
1999) Although they gibberellin and auxin use two different mechanisms to induce cell elongation, they both have the same effect.
However, the chemicals effects on cellular elongation alone are not sufficient to hypothesize which chemical the unkown(s) may be.
The crucial piece of information needed to make a prediction lays in observation of node (leaf) formation. gibberellin promotes cell division in the shoot system.
(Campbell et al.
1999) Although its specific effect on node formation was unfounded, it would be reasonable to conclude this inductive effect on cell division could support the increased rate of node formation seen (as compared to the control) since cell division is obviously needed for organogenesis (in this case, the organ being the leaf).
However, I ruled out gibberellin (and it's inhibitor) after looking at the effects of Auxin on the shoot system.
Although auxin inhibits lateral branching (formation of new stem from the main shoot), auxin has been conclusively associated with inducing leaf formation.
Auxin does this by promoting cell division in the vascular cambium.
Leaves (which create nodes) have to originate from vascular cambium, in order to make a continuous transport system in the plant.
(Berleth et al.
2000) Because of this definite correlation of increased internode elongation and node formation, I am predicting that the compounds involved are auxin and an auxin inhibitor.
The first hypothesis is that T1L and T1H are auxin treatments and they will produce a greater percent change for the number of internodes, length of internode elongation, and total plant height as compared to the control treatment.
Although they will not be statistically compared, I am also predicting that the higher concentration treatment will produce more dramatic effects.
The second hypothesis is that T2L and T2H are auxin inhibitors and they will produce a lower percent change for the number of internodes, length of internode elongation, and total plant height as compared to the control treatment.
Again, I would predict that T2H's effects would be more dramatic than T2L's effects because it has a greater concentration of the compound.
