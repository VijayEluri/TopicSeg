This experiment tested the effects of different unknown solutions on plant growth.
The major goal of this experiment is to determine the effect of the unknown solution on plant growth and to identify these unknown solutions.
There are five major classes of plant hormones that may have been part of the solutions, and they are: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
It is also possible that a hormone inhibitor was used in the treatments.
These hormones could have affected the plants in a number of ways depending on what hormone was used, if any, and the type of tissue they come in contact with.
The processes affected by the hormones are cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination, flowering, and senescence.
Senescence is the plant growth from maturity to death that is characterized by a build up of metabolic products, increase in respiratory rate, and a loss of leaves and fruits.
The hormone class auxin is defined as any chemical substance that promotes cell elongation.
If we see growth in our results after the plants are treated then auxin might be in the treatment used.
Auxin is primarily produced in the apical meristem.
If the concentration of auxin is too high it may have an inhibitory effect on cell elongation.
Auxin can also stimulate secondary growth by inducing cell division on the vascular cambium and by influencing differentiation of secondary xylem.
Developing seeds also synthesize auxin, which promotes the growth of fruit in many plants (Campbell, 755.)
The only known naturally occurring auxin is Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA).
IAA, once synthesized in the apical meristem, moves to the site of elongation where it stimulates cell growth.
IAA also has the affect of apical dominance, which is the inhibition of lateral bud growth (Burpee, 1-2.)
Cytokinins are plant hormones that stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
Cytokinins are produced in the roots, and unlike auxin stimulate lateral bud elongation.
Therefore, more lateral bud growth will occur near the base of a plant where cytokinin levels are high compared to auxin.
Cytokinins are most likely not part of the treatments since we are not looking for lateral bud growth.
The third hormone class is the gibberellins, and they affect the plant in a number of different ways including plant growth, fruit growth, and seed germination.
The largest effect is stem elongation and stimulation of cell division.
Therefore, if the results show any bolting, or large stem growth, then we can assume that gibberellins were used to treat the plant.
In very large doses gibberellins can cause bolting, which is when plants grow very tall and spindly.
In very low doses plants can exhibit dwarfism, or extreme shortness.
The fourth class of hormones is abscisic acid (ABA), and it is produced in the terminal buds.
ABA inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium.
During periods of water stress ABA promotes closure of stomata resulting in water conservation for plants.
If ABA is used in one of the treatments it should show a decrease in plant growth.
The last group of hormones is ethylene and it is a gas, unlike the other hormones.
It is a growth inhibitor, and it causes the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruit.
Therefore ethylene speeds up senescence.
Being that ethylene is a gas, it was also probably not used in the treatments.
