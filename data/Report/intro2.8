Plants unlike animal have the ability to continue to grow throughout their lifespan.
Plants like humans use hormones as a growth regulatory method.
Controlling the growth of plants uses several hormones.
There are five main hormones that were discussed in the lab.
The five hormones are auxin, cytokinins, gebberellins, absciisic acid and ethylene.
Each hormone acts on the plant in different ways.
Auxin promotes apical dominace, which is a response to sunlight and CO2 fixation.
Cytokinins promotes root formation y cell division.
Gibberellins promote stem elongation and can cause the plant to grow very tall and spindly.
Absciisic acid promotes dormancy in plants by closing the stromata plants.
By closing the stromata the plant is able to conserve water loss.
Ethylene, which is a gas acts as a growth inhibitor to plants and also promotes fruit ripening and rotting (Burpee et al 2004) .
In this experiment the purpose was to determine the effect of an unknown hormone and it's effect on the growth of pea plants.
Pea plants were use due to their fast growth rate over a two-week period.
The null hypothesis was that there is no change in growth with respect to the treatment of hormone.
The alternative hypothesis is that there is a growth change plants with respect to the plants` response to the unknown hormone.
This data will show that the hormone gibberellin and its inhibitor was the unknown compound used for the treatments high and low.
The data results of the experiment depicts one of the five hormones affected the growth rate of pea plants over a two -week period of time.
Difference concentration of hormones were used the higher concentrations had a greater affect.
