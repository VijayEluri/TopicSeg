Plant hormones or growth factors play an important role in almost every aspect of plant growth and are used frequently in agriculture.
From responding to tropisms to maturation and abscission of fruits and leaves, these small relatively simple chemical compounds are indispensable.
The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of the independent variable, two unknown treatments and one control, on three dependent variables, total plant height, total number of internodes, and average internode length.
Since all the dependent variables are somehow related to vertical plant growth, it may be assumed that the treatments will either increase or decrease the concentration or activity of a certain growth factor that is important for stem elongation in pea plants.
Out of the seven types of plant hormones only three are known to play a role in stem elongation; these are auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Since these hormones are known to promote stem elongation, high concentrations of promoters of theses hormones should cause pea plants to grow much taller than control plants which are sprayed with water.
Low concentrations of promoters of theses hormones should still cause the plants to grow taller than control plants but not as tall as those treated with high concentrations.
Plants treated with high concentrations of substances that inhibit these hormones should be significantly shorter than control plants, since it is deficiencies in growth factors like gibberellins that cause dwarfism in plants (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Low concentrations of these inhibitors should have a similar though not as dramatic effect on plant height as high inhibitor concentrations.
As for internode number and length, since both auxins and gibberellins cause an increase in internode length and brassinosteroids have similar effects (Raven and Johnston, 2002) internodes in the presence of a promoter of these hormones would be expected to grow longer while their number remained similar to the number of internodes observed in the control group.
This assumption can be made because auxins and gibberellins cause stem elongation by promoting elongation of individual plant cells (Penn State Biology Department, 2004) rather than by increasing the number of internodes in a plant.
Because of this lack of correlation between internode number and concentrations of auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids it may also be assumed that inhibition of these hormones would not result in a change in the number of internodes even though it would result in a decrease in length of these internodes.
The concentrations of inhibitor or promoter should have a similar effect on internode length as it did on plant height.
High concentrations of promoter would produce longer internodes than low concentrations, and the length of the internodes of plants treated with low concentrations of promoter would be longer than the internodes of the control plants.
On the other hand, low concentrations of inhibitor would produce shorter internodes than the control and high inhibitor concentrations would have still shorter internodes.
