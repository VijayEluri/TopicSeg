Plants are able to sense and respond to their environment using internal chemical messengers called plant hormones.
There are five major classes of plant hormones that are able to control plant growth: auxin, cytokinin, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxin promotes elongation of shoot growth.
Cytokinins both stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation.
Gibberellins have a variety of effects on plant growth including stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Abscisic acid inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium as well as control water loss by closing stomata.
Ethylene is a gaseous compound that acts as a growth inhibitor and is involved in the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits.
If unknown compounds were to be sprayed on pea plants, could one tell if the compound is either an elongation hormone or a growth inhibitor hormone?
The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether an unknown compound sprayed onto a pea plant is either a growth promoter or inhibitor hormone.
If the plant grows taller with respect to the control plant, which is sprayed with water, then it would be safe to assume that the unknown compound applied is a hormone that promotes growth.
If the plant does not grow or if the plant grows very little compared to the control plant, than it can be assumed that the unknown compound is a hormone that inhibits growth.
