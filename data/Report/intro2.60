This experiment deals with the effects of unknown hormone compounds on pea seedling growth.
Two hormone compounds with two different concentrations were applied to the plants.
There was also a group of control plants present that were not exposed to any type of hormone compound.
Data was taken for both the control plants as well as the hormone treated plants before the treatment as well as one week after hormone treatment.
The purpose of the experiment was to observe the effects of hormone application on plant growth as well as to identify the unknown hormone compounds.
The plants will be compared on a basis of average height, average internode number, and average internode length.
An internode is defined as the part of a shoot between two nodes, which is a part of the stem where one or more leaves arise.
Plants have an amazing ability to respond to stimuli from their environment.
These responses to environmental factors are known as tropisms.
In order to respond to their ever changing external environment, plants use chemical messengers that carry signals from one part of the plant to another.
These chemical messengers are known as plant hormones.
Plants are able to use hormones to regulate their rate and direction of growth, to control the time at which they produce flowers and drop leaves, and to function in germination (Levine).
There are five major classes of plant hormones that have been identified: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene (Biology).
Auxin has been identified to promote cell growth, stimulate stem and root elongation, and control gravitropism and phototropism.
Auxin originates in the meristems of shoots and roots.
High concentrations of auxin can also inhibit the growth of lateral buds; this is a phenomenon known as apical dominance (Levine).
Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) is a naturally occurring auxin (Biology).
Cytokinins are another plant hormone known to stimulate cell division and growth and seem to complement many of the effects of auxin (Levine).
The ratio of cytokinin to auxin determines whether a cell will differentiate into a root or shoot.
It is also important to note that while auxin inhibits lateral growth, cytokinin stimulates it.
Cytokinin chemistry is similar to that of adenine and is produced in actively growing tissues (Biology).
Gibberellins stimulate stem elongation and bud and fruit development.
Gibberellins are also known to make plants grow unusually tall, also referred to as bolting (Biology).
Applying gibberellin to a growing plant can result in a rapid increase in the length of stems between branch nodes (Levine).
Abscisic acid is a plant hormone released from terminal buds and is known to inhibit the growth of buds and vascular cambium, and promote dormancy (Biology).
Abscisic acid can help a plant cope with abnormal environmental conditions such as drought and winter.
Ethylene is a gaseous compound that acts as a growth inhibitor and stimulates the ripening of fruit on plants (Biology).
It is also involved in senescence, the abscission of leaves, flowers and plants.
Ethylene has an opposite effect of auxins, because auxins prolong the length of time that these structures stay on the plant (Levine).
Summing the effects to the five major classes of plant hormones, it is then easier to deduce the unknown hormone compound by the growth changes that it evokes.
If the unknown compound is composed of gibberellins, the plant will grow very tall and internode length will increase.
If either ethylene or abscisic acid is applied to the plants, growth will be inhibited.
If auxin is applied to the pea seedlings, the plant shoots will elongate and lateral growth will be inhibited.
However, if cytokinin is applied to the plant, lateral growth will be stimulated.
