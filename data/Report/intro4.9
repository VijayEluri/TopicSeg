Plants have numerous chemical messengers, called plant hormones, which relay information to different tissues causing these tissues to react in various ways depending on the tissue type and the type of hormone.
In our experiment, we were only interested in the top five: auxin, cytokinin, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene and primarily just the first three of these.
Abscisic acid and ethylene are primarily involved with the processes of senescence, for which our experiment did not observe.
In this experiment, we are to determine which hormone or combination of hormones was used by measuring different variables of plant growth with which these chemicals are involved.
These variables were total height, number of internodes, and average length of those internodes.
Depending on the responses of these variables, we should be able to suggest which hormones were used.
