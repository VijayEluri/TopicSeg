Plants, similarly to animals, have hormones of which there are five types.
These hormones supplement their indeterminate growth pattern whereby plants continuously change to adapt to their environment instead of it being genetically predetermined.
Shoot elongation is promoted by the hormone auxin, while it also inhibits lateral growth through apical dominance.
Cytokinins promote lateral bud growth and cell division via differentiation.
Another plant hormone, gibberellin, promotes stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Abscisic acid allows plants to deal with arid environments and the final hormone, ethylene, promotes the ripening of fruit (Cyr, R.J., and C.J. Paradise, 2004).
In this experiment pea seedlings were treated with two different concentrations of a hormone.
The differences in growth were recorded in order to determine the significance of these hormones on plant growth.
It is predicted that one treatment will consist of two different concentrations of a hormone while the other treatment is two concentrations of its inhibitor.
It can therefore be hypothesized that a low concentration of auxin will increase total height of the plant, the number of internodes, as well as the average length of the internodes.
High concentrations of this hormone will have an even greater effect.
On the other hand, low concentrations of cytokinin will inhibit growth of the seedlings, allowing for a less significant increase in total height, number of internodes, and average length of the internodes.
High concentrations of cytokinin will inhibit growth even further.
Analysis of the experimental data will determine whether or not there is a significant difference in growth when treated with either hormone and if a difference in concentration affects plant growth.
