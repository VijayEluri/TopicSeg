Thanks to indeterminate growth the same species of plant can grow into many different shapes and sizes.
There are also many different tropisms that can affect plant growth, such as phototropism gravitropism and thigmotropism.
However the tropism used in this study is chemotropism.
High and low concentrations of two different treatments were used to affect the growth of pea seedlings.
 The purpose of this experiment is to see the effects of the treatments and to determine which treatment was a plant growth hormone or a plant growth hormone inhibitor. Some questions that were mentioned during the initial stages of the experiment were; how much effect would the plant hormones really have on the pea seedlings? And, what would the difference be between the high and low level treatments?  These questions will be answered by the end of the experiment where it is believed that the data will show that plants receiving a high concentration of treatment will have new growth that is significantly larger then the new growth of the controls plants, and also plants receiving a low concentration will have new growth that is slightly larger then the control's new growth.  It is also believed that plants receiving the other treatment will have the reverse effect.  High concentrations of the other treatment will result in plants with new growth that is significantly smaller, and low concentrations will have new growth that is only slightly smaller.==========
