What causes growth?
This is an important question that is asked about every living organism because they all exhibit growth during their lifetime and, naturally, we want to be able to understand how it happens.
In this experiment, the focus is put on plant growth.
When dealing with growth, plants are different to animals in that they exhibit indeterminate growth, meaning that they have growth with no genetically predefined limits.
Nevertheless, plant growth are caused and affected by plant hormones, or chemical messengers.
These hormones influences processes in plants such as cell division, cell enlargement, and cell differentiation (1).
There are five kinds of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are hormones that are mainly responsible for elongation of coleoptiles and young shoots.
Cytokinins are known for causing cell division and differentiation.
Furthermore, it works with auxins to regulate growth.
Gibberellins are a type of hormone that causes stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
Similar to cytokinins, it works with auxins to promote cell elongation in stems.
It is known that high doses of this hormone can cause plant to grow very tall while low doses will cause the plant to be dwarf.
Unlike the previous hormones, the fourth type abscisic acid is different in that it inhibits bud growth and vascular cambium.
The last kind of hormone, ethylene, is a gaseous compound that acts as a growth inhibitor.
It is important in senescence of the plant and causes abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits (1).
The five major classes of hormones can be divided into two kinds, growth hormones and growth inhibitors.
Auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins would be classified as growth hormones while both abscisic acid and ethylene are growth inhibitors.
It is the purpose of this lab to experiment with two unknown treatments and observe the effects they have on the growth of pea plants, focusing on the three variables of total height, number of internodes, and average internode length.
Not only do we want to understand how hormones affect growth in this lab, we also want to be able to identify what the unknown treatments are by using the results we obtain (1).
The expected outcome is that if the plant growth is more in the control (receiving water only) compared to the one receiving an unknown treatment, then that treatment would be a growth inhibitor.
Furthermore, if plant growth is less in the control compared to a plant receiving a particular treatment, then it would be a growth hormone.
