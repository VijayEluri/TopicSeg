Living organisms must respond to their environment to ensure survival.
Plants are stationary, hence cannot react to stimuli through motility.
Instead, plants respond to environmental cues by altering their patterns of growth and development.
Unlike most animals, plants are able to grow and differ throughout their entire lifespan, which is known as indeterminate growth.
This allows a plant to adjust growth patterns to maximize reproductive success for its given surroundings.
Chemical messengers known as plant hormones supply the internal signals that govern plant's adaptive physiology.
There are five major classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are chemical substances that are responsible for the elongation of coleoptiles.
The only naturally occurring auxin is Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), which functions to stimulate elongation of cells in young shoots, while suppressing the growth of lateral buds.
Auxin is responsible fore apical dominance, as well as phototropic response.
Cytokinins are responsible fore cell division and the regulation of the pathway of differentiation.
The chemical structure of this hormone is similar to that of the nucleotide adenine.
They play an important role in regulating growth patterns, active as a complimentary force to auxins.
The balance between these two hormones regulates apical dominance and cell differentiation.
Gibberellins are a large class of naturally occurring plant hormones that effect stem elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
They collaborate with auxins to stimulate cell division and elongation in the stem.
High doses of gibberellins causes the tall and spindly growth of a plant known as bolting.
The fourth plant hormone is abscisic acid (ABA).
This hormone is responsible fore dormancy, inhibiting the growth of buds and vascular cambium in order to survive undesirable environmental conditions.
The only gaseous hormone, ethylene diffuses through air spaces between plant cells, acting as a growth inhibitor.
It is accountable for the aging process, counteracting auxins to control the life cycle of the plant.
Plant hormones take action in response to environmental factors, often changing the course of growth.
These growth responses are known as tropisms.
There are three main types of tropisms that can be observed in plants.
Phototropism is the response to a unidirectional source of light, and causes a plant to grow towards light.
The cells on the darker side of the plant have greater levels of auxins, which cause faster elongation; hence the plant bends towards the light source.
Gravitropism is the upward and downward growth of the plant.
Negative gravitropism causes the aerial parts of the plant to grow up towards sunlight, and positive gravitorpism causes roots to grow downwards into the soil.
Thigmotropism is the directional growth in response to touch.
This results from an increased production of ethylene in response to continuous mechanical stimulation.
The development, growth, and survival of plants under a wide range of environmental conditions reflect an intricate interplay of physical and chemical conditions with the highly integrated sensing and response networks in plants.
The addition of growth hormones or growth inhibitors has a highly visible effect on plants.
The concentration of these substances will also affect the growth results.
In this lab, two plant hormones will be applied to pea plants in varying concentrations and the observed results will allow the unknown hormones to be identified.
