The different plant hormones that may have been used were auxin, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Each of these hormones affects plant growth in a different way.
Auxin help to promote shoot growth and they also promote apical dominance.
Apical dominance is the phenomenon when the closer the lateral bud is to the apex of the plant the more suppressed the bud becomes.
Cytokinins are involved with the division of cells and also help to regulate the pathway of differentiation.
Cytokinins also help to stimulate lateral bud growth.
This means that closer to the roots there will be more lateral bud growth because cytokinins are produced in the roots.
Gibberellins cause stem elongation, fruit growth and also aid in seed germination.
The fourth plant hormone is abscisic acid, which is produced in the terminal buds.
This hormone reduces bud growth and growth in the vascular cambium.
Abscisic acid is useful in harsh weather conditions because it allows the plant to become dormant and stay alive in dismal conditions.
The final plant hormone is ethylene.
Ethylene is unique because it is the only plant hormone that is gaseous.
Ethylene is also a growth inhibitor.
Ethylene is involved with the abscission of leaves, fruits and flowers at the right time (Bio. 240 Lab Manual).
The purpose of this lab was to determine the affects that different plant hormones had on the growth of pea plants.
Before the experiment was preformed, the group proposed that if the plants outgrow the control plants then they were probably treated with a growth stimulating hormone such as auxin or a gibberllin; however, if the plants did not grow as much as the control plants then the plants were most likely treated with a growth inhibitor such as abscisic acid.
