There are several growth hormones found in plants which stimulate, inhibit and control various degrees of plant development.
Auxin is one such hormone that helps plants grow and respond to their environment.
Cytokinins, in association with auxin, increase cell division and differentiation.
Gibberellins stimulate cell elongation in the presence of light, which is enhanced by the company of auxin.
They also speed up seed germination as well as flower growth (Raven and Johnson 2002)
First discovered as Gibberella fujikuroi, the fungus caused abnormal growth in rice plants.
Gibberella encompass a large group of over 100 naturally occurring hormones in plants called gibberellins (Raven and Johnson 2002).
The discovery led researchers to come across several hormones that promoted growth such as gibberellic acid (GA); a natural hormone which can be extracted from plants.
Gibberellins tend to promote uniform plant growth through cell enlargement as well as increase internode spacing (Wright 1993).
Gibberellins are numbered with different subscripts in order to differentiate between them.
According to King et. al, modifications of GA5 can act as inhibitors by competing with a substrate of GA enzymes (2004).
Varied forms of GA can have drastically different effects on plants and how they grow.
In this lab six plants were divided into three groups of two for an assortment of treatments.
Two plants will be treated with a control, two plants will be treated with one concentration and two plants will be treated with a second concentration of one treatment.
Various groups will use one of two treatments each at two different concentrations.
Since we know that both treatment one and treatment two will affect one hormone, the purpose of this lab is to observe the effects of an unknown treatment and then identify that unknown treatment.
It is expected that the data from one treatment will show the internode length increase and the data from the other treatment to show a decrease in internode length.
If the results are as expected, it can be determined that the stimulatory treatment is gibberellic acid and the inhibitory treatment is a gibberellic acid inhibitor, possibly GA5.
The null hypothesis for this experiment is that neither of the treatments will have an effect on the plants.
The alternative hypothesis would then state that the treatments will affect the plants and there will therefore be a difference between the treated plants and the control plants.
