Many factors have an effect on the way and rate at which plants grow, such as water, sunlight, and available carbon dioxide.
However, other chemicals signals, known as hormones, also have an effect on the development of plants.
The five classes of plants hormones are Auxin, Cytokinins, Gibberellins, Ethylene, and Abscisic acid.
Each of these hormones has a main effect on a plant, but it is the combination of the hormones (ratios) that give the overall effect.
Auxin promotes apical dominance, enhances stem elongation, and inhibits elongation in the roots.
Cytokinins, on the other hand, promote cell division in the roots, and inhibit cell division in the shoots.
Gibberellins promote seed germination and floral development.
Ethylene causes abscission in leaves and fruit ripening, as well as water logging.
Finally, Abscisic acid causes seed maturation, seed dormancy, and regulates stomatal function (Raven and Johnson 2002).
Plants have evolved to change to fit their environments.
By altering the substances a plant is exposed to, a person can control the shape and function of the plant.
It is important to study the effects of hormones on plants so that the agriculture industry can more efficiently produce fruits, flowers, etc.
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of hormones on plant growth and to determine which hormones were used (either inhibiting or promoting growth) on the plants.
Many questions could have been answered by conducting this lab, such as to test to see if different concentrations of hormones had a greater or weaker effect on plant growth, and to see to what degree the hormones alter plant growth in a two week period.
At the end of this experiment, the data will show that the control group plants will grow at a steady pace, where as the treatment plants will either be growth inhibited, or show a drastic increase in growth (compared to the control plants).
