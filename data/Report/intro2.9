Plants, due to being rooted to a particular location for all of their lives, spend a lot of time responding to the environment in which they live.
Plants can adjust their patterns of growth and development depending on how they need to grow to maximize their reproductive success.
Besides just environmental cues, small internal chemical messengers called plant hormones also determine the growth of a plant.
Plant hormones are moved to all parts of the plant to relay messages.
Hormones can have a multitude of effects on the plant such as cell division, cell enlargement, cell differentiation, polarity of growth, pattern of branching, seed germination, flowering and senescence (Lab Manual).
The exact effect of the hormones depends on the environmental cues that the plant is receiving.
In addition, many hormones act together to produce a balanced growth of a plant.
There are five major classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.
Auxins are hormones that promote elongation of the shoot of a plant.
Auxin is produced in the apical meristem of shoots where it then moves down to the shoot where it stimulates cell elongation.
Auxin suppresses the growth of lateral shoots, which is explained by apical dominance (Lab Manual).
Cytokinins are plant hormones that "stimulate cell division and regulate the pathway of differentiation" (Lab Manual).
Cytokinins are produced in the roots and opposite to auxin; they tend to promote lateral bud growth in the shoots.
Gibberellins are another plant hormone, which stimulates cell elongation, fruit growth, and seed germination.
High concentrations of gibberellins cause plants to grow very tall and spindly.
Very small doses cause dwarfism.
Abscisic Acid "inhibits the growth of buds and vascular cambium" (Lab Manual).
In this way, abscisic acid promotes dormancy and helps a plant deal with drought or other adverse conditions.
Ethylene is the last of the five hormones and acts as a growth inhibitor.
It is involved with the process of senescence and the abscission of leaves, flowers, and fruits at the end of a growing season.
The purpose of this lab is to explore the effect of different hormones on plant growth.
Of a complete sample of 652 plants, some will be treated with just water, which will act as the control.
The rest of the plants will either be treated with an unknown treatment 1 or an unknown treatment 2 and in either high or low concentrations.
We will be able to compare our results for the plants sprayed with a treatment to the control.
We will measure total plant height, number of internodes, and length of internodes.
The question we are asking is how will the application of a hormone change the total plant height, the number of internodes, and the length of internodes.
The differences we obtain will show the type of hormone that was the unknown.
If the plant grew taller and had more internodes after the treatment, then that would probably mean that the hormone stimulated shoot elongation.
If the plant didn't grow very much, then the hormone applied could have been an inhibitor for growth.
