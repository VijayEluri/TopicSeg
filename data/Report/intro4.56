Plants may not appear to be similar to animals, but they are biologically very similar.
Plants, like animals, respond to outside environmental cues as well as internal cues.
These internal cues might be delivered by plant hormones (Lab Manual).
There are five major classes of plant hormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene (Lab Manual).
Auxins, cytokinins and gibberellins are all growth promoters, while abscisic acid and ethylene are both growth inhibitors.
In specific, auxins promote shoot growth, gibberellins promote internode growth, and cytokinins stimulate lateral bud growth.
In this experiment, Pea seedlings were treated with unknown hormones with varying concentrations, and the purpose of this experiment was to determine what hormone the seedling was treated with.
Class data was compiled, so that we could observe the trends more clearly with more data present.
This data will enable us to determine what seedlings were treated with what hormones, and to enable us to observe the effects of varying concentrations of the different unknown hormones on pea seedling growth.
This data will also help us observe the effects of an external stimulus on a plant, and how it causes the plant to respond.
There were two treatments, each involved the use of a different hormone, either a growth inhibitor or a growth stimulator.
Each treatment had a control, low concentration, and high concentration.
Growth of the overall seedling, number of internodes, and internode length was recorded twice over a two week period, in order to determine what hormone was used in each treatment.
