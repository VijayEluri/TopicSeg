Some plants have been recorded at heights over 350 feet!
While many may think this impossible, it is a well known fact that both Redwoods and Giant Sequoias can grow to extremely large heights.
This stunning growth pattern is made possible by indeterminate growth.
Indeterminate growth means that plants do not have a predetermined program for growth.
Plants can continue to grow throughout their lives.
This property also allows for plants to adjust their growth patterns in order to adapt to their environment and the changes that may occur (Lab Manual).
Plant growth can be altered by the addition of certain hormones that are capable of changing certain aspects of growth.
Such hormones are Auxins, Gibberellins, Cytokinins, Abscisic acid, and Ethylene.
Each of these hormones is responsible for controlling different characteristics of the plant (Lab Manual).
Auxins are a classification of plant hormones that promote elongation of the shoot for example.
One example of an Auxin is Indole-3-Acetic acid also known as IAA (Lab Manual).
IAA is sent to specific cells and elicits a specific response in the plant which is to elongate the stem mainly (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Gibberellins are synthesized in apical meristems of shoots and roots.
Like Auxins, Gibberellins also have an effect on stem elongation (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Gibberellins also have an effect on fruit growth and seed germination.
High concentrations of Gibberellins can cause the plant to grow very tall relatively quickly (Lab Manual).
In some plant species, Gibberellins are used to elongate the internodes so fruits have more room to grow (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Cytokinin is usually produced in the root of the plant and is then transported throughout the plant (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
The hormone is able to move up the plant via the xylem (Lab Manual).
This hormone is very important in regulating the growth patterns of plants; it stimulates cell division as well as the differentiation of cells (Raven and Johnson, 2002).
Cytokinin does not have a dramatic effect of the vertical growth of the plant, rather, high levels of cytokinin increases branching along the shoot (Lab Manual).
Abscisic acid is responsible for inhibiting the growth of buds and the vascular cambium and therefore is responsible for promoting dormancy in plants.
This hormone is also responsible for helping a plant cope with such environmental conditions as drought by promoting the closure of stomata on the plant leaves (Lab Manual).
Ethylene is a gas that is able to diffuse through the plant between air spaces in the cells of the shoots, roots and leaves.
Ethylene is a hormone that inhibits growth in the plant.
Ethylene is responsible for the abscission of leaves and fruits and therefore works with auxin to enable the dropping of leaves and fruits usually in the fall (Lab Manual).
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the identity of the two hormones with which the pea plants are treated.
The growth of the plant will be recorded over two weeks in order to determine the effects of the treatment and the data will be analyzed to determine the identity.
I hypothesize that the hormone treatments in the higher concentrations will have a greater effect on plant growth than the lower concentration.
