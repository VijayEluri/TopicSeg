Plants must interact with the environment in order to survive.
Specifically, plant hormones are the internal chemical messengers that interact with the environment, affecting certain processes including cell division, cell differentiation, and flowering.
These hormones, which include auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acids, and ethylene, are produced in many areas of the plant and transported throughout to different tissues (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
To create an effect, a hormone binds to a protein receptor that sends a signal to activate specific genes.
These genes produce an enzyme that causes the specific change induced by the hormone (Knee, 2000).
Several factors determine the effect of the hormone.
One of these factors is concentration (Cyr and Paradise, 1994).
 The purpose of this experiment was to treat Pisum stivum seedlings, pea seedlings, with two unknown compounds of two different concentrations, high and low, to determine the identity of the compounds based upon changes due to the application of the compounds in the total plant height, the internode number, and the average internode length of the pea seedlings after one week.  It was hypothesized that if one of the compounds caused a larger increase in the total plant height, the internode number, and the average internode length than the untreated plant over time, the compound stimulated plant growth.  In addition, if one of the compounds caused a smaller increase in the total plant height, the internode number, and the average internode length than the untreated plant over time, the compound inhibited plant growth.==========
