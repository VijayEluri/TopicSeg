Plants play a critical role in the survival of animals, providing a source of oxygen, shelter, and edible resources for a few examples.
Overtime, intensive research has gone into understanding how plants develop, what causes their growth, and the control of their life cycle.
Plants survival mechanisms are also investigated, and are in contrast to animal mechanisms because they lack things essential to an animal's existence, including muscular, immune, and nervous systems (Campbell 1996).
A significant factor that influences these situations and allows a plant to respond to its environment are plant hormones.
Plant hormones are similar to animal hormones in the small quantity that are produced and their transport to areas of use.
However plants synthesize their hormones in a variety of tissues and a single hormone can have multiple affects depending on tissue specificity and the timing of development (Bupree, Leicht, 2004).
They are organized into five basic families: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscidic acid and ethylene (Campbell 1996).
Other hormones are continuing to be found and new control and interactions are also being researched.
The role of hormones in plant growth will be investigated in this experiment.
Pea seedlings will be subjected to two treatments, one a hormone and one a hormone inhibitor.
The effect on plant height will be determined by observing the change in total plant height, the number of internodes, and the average internode length after one week of treatment.
Gathering this information can help determine which compounds the plants have been subjected to.
It is expected that these data will show an increase in the change of height of the plants, an increase in the change of the number of internodes, and an increase in the average internode length, all compared to the control.
