George Washington (1732-1799) was a founding father and the lead general in the American Revolution. He was elected as the first president of the United States of America - the only president ever to win a unanimous vote in the Electoral College - and served two terms before retiring.
George Washington was a Virginia planter, commander of the Continental army, and first president of the United States. Washington was the son of Augustine Washington, a Virginia planter of modest wealth. When he died in 1743, George went to live with his older brother at Mount Vernon.
As a youth, Washington worked as a surveyor and in 1754 was sent with a military expedition to maintain Virginia's claim to Ohio lands against the French. In a battle fought in the wilderness he and most of his men were forced to surrender. After his release, he was appointed head of Virginia's militia on the frontier and served until 1758.
In 1759, Washington married Martha Custis, a wealthy widow. Marriage and the responsibilities of running a plantation helped him mature emotionally and intellectually. By 1770 he was an experienced leader-a vestryman, a justice of the peace, and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses.
He was a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, where John Adams remarked on his "soldier-like air" and, along with everyone else, thought he was the natural leader of the Continental army when it took shape in 1775.
As military commander, Washington's strategy grew from a clear vision of the large political objective of the Revolution: independence. His task was to hold the army together and maintain an armed resistance to the British forces in America while Congress sought foreign aid and recognition. The army had to remain intact to persuade Britain that the Americans were not going to surrender; only when that conviction pervaded British governing circles would independence be won.
During the war Washington suffered several defeats, but he held his forces together and won at Trenton and Princeton (1776-1777), and most important, at Yorktown (1781). His leadership and sense of strategy made him a superb commander in chief. His respect for civilian control, despite the weakness of Congress, proved especially important to the new Republic.
When the war ended, Washington returned to Mount Vernon and the life of a tobacco planter. But he was called out of retirement to preside at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 at Philadelphia. His great prestige supported the new government and made his election as the first president of the United States almost inevitable.
Washington's achievements as president were also enormous. He was creating a new government-its institutions, offices, and practices were not completely described in the Constitution-and he persuaded the American people that their future lay in a union under a strong central authority.
Cabinet members Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson soon disagreed over domestic and foreign policy. Washington backed Hamilton on key issues-the funding of the national debt, the assumption of state debts, and the establishment of a national bank chartered by the federal government-but he did not favor Hamilton's plan for the support of manufactures. Washington felt more confident of his knowledge of foreign affairs than he did of domestic policy. In 1790 when Spain seized three British ships in Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, territory claimed by the Spanish, Washington maintained American neutrality and did the same in 1793 when war broke out between France and England. Jefferson objected, urging that the Treaty of Alliance with France be upheld, and left the government not long after. Washington settled outstanding issues with Britain through Jay's Treaty (1795) and with Spain through Pinckney's Treaty (1795). He put down the farmers in western Pennsylvania who instigated the Whiskey Rebellion (1794) and dealt a blow to the Indians of Ohio, after they were defeated by Gen. Anthony Wayne, in the Treaty of Greenville (1795).
In Washington's first term, an opposition began to make itself heard, and in his second term, the outlines of the first party system, composed of the Democratic-Republican and Federalist parties, became clear. Washington never understood the need for political parties, seeing something sinister in them. Fatigued and somewhat discouraged, he retired to Mount Vernon after he left the presidency.
