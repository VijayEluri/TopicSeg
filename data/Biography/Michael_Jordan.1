Michael Jordan (born February 17, 1963) is a retired American basketball player. Many people believe Jordan is one of the greatest basketball players to ever play in the NBA. He won six championships playing for the Chicago Bulls and head coach Phil Jackson. The Chicago Bulls team set a record by winning 72 games. Jordan was part of this team and played together with men like Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen, and Toni Kukoc. Jordan won two Olympic gold medals for basketball. His first gold medal was in 1984 as a college player and his second was in 1992 as an NBA player.
As a sophomore at Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, Jordan did not make his school's varsity (main) basketball team. This inspired him to work harder. In 1981, he went to the University of North Carolina to play. He averaged 13.5 points per game his freshman year, and 20 points per game his sophomore year. North Carolina won the national championship in 1982, Jordan's freshman year. Jordan made the winning shot with 17 seconds left in the championship game. After Jordan's junior year in college, he announced that he would be leaving college to play in the NBA. The Chicago Bulls chose him with the third pick in the 1984 NBA draft.
In 1993, after winning three NBA championships in a row, Jordan announced that he would retire and switch to a career in minor league baseball. He played for the Birmingham Barons, a minor league team in the Chicago White Sox's system, but hit only one home run during his whole baseball career. 
In 1995, Jordan announced that he would return to the NBA with a two word announcement: "I'm back". He was back in time to play for the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs, but the Bulls did not win the championship. But the next three seasons after that, the Bulls would win the championship. This included the 1995-1996 season, when the Bulls won 72 games in the regular season and only lost 10. No NBA team has ever won more regular season games in one season. Jordan retired for a second time in 1998, but was still not done playing. He would buy part of the Washington Wizards basketball team, and played for the Wizards from 2001 to 2003, and ended his playing career after that.
Jordan now owns most of the Charlotte Bobcats. He was chosen to enter the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009.
