Napoleon Bonaparte (French: Napoléon Bonaparte French pronunciation: &#160; [napoleɔ̃ bɔnɑpaʁt], Italian: Napoleone di Buonaparte;  15 August 1769 &#160; – 5 May 1821), was a military and political leader of France. He was also Emperor of the French as Napoleon I. His actions shaped European politics in the early 19th century.
He was born in Corsica. His parents were of noble Italian birth. He trained as an officer in mainland France. Bonaparte became important under the First French Republic. He led successful campaigns against the First and Second Coalitions. In 1799, he staged a coup d'état. Through this, he became a First Consul. Five years later the French Senate declared him Emperor. In the first ten years of the nineteenth century, the French Empire under Napoleon went through a great number of wars. These were called the Napoleonic Wars. Every great European power joined in these wars. After a number of victories, France became very important in continental Europe. Napoleon kept up their influence. He did this by making many alliances. He also made friends and family members rule other European countries as French client states.
The French invasion of Russia in 1812 began a turning point in Napoleon's fortunes. His army was badly damaged in the campaign. It was never the same again. In 1813, the Sixth Coalition defeated his forces at Leipzig. The year after that, the Coalition attacked France. The Caolition also exiled Napoleon to the island of Elba. Less than a year later, he escaped Elba and became powerful again. However, he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon spent the last six years of his life confined by the British on the island of Saint Helena. A doctor he died of stomach cancer. However, Sten Forshufvud and other scientists have suggested that he was poisoned with arsenic.
Napoleon's campaigns are studied at military schools all over the world. He is remembered as a tyrant by the people who was against him. However, he is also remembered for making the Napoleonic code.
Napoleon Bonaparte was born in Casa Buonaparte in the town of Ajaccio, Corsica, on 15 August 1769. This was one year after the island was given to France by the Republic of Genoa. He was the second of eight children. He was named Napoleone di Buonaparte. He took his first name from an uncle who had been killed fighting the French. However, he later used the more French-sounding Napoléon Bonaparte.[note 1]
The Corsican Buonapartes were from lower Italian nobility. They had come to Corsica in the 16th century. His father Nobile Carlo Buonaparte became Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1777. The greatest influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, Maria Letizia Ramolino. Her firm education controlled a wild child. He had an older brother, Joseph. He also had younger siblings Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline and Jérôme. Napoleon was baptized as a Catholic just before his second birthday, on 21 July 1771 at Ajaccio Cathedral.
Napoleon was able to enter the military academy at Brienne in 1779. He was nine years old when he entered the academy. He moved to the Parisian École Royale Militaire in 1784 and graduated a year later as a second lieutenant of artillery. Napoleon was able to spend much of the next eight years in Corsica. There he played an active part in political and military matters. He came into conflict with the Corsican nationalist Pasquale Paoli, and his family was forced to flee to Marsille in 1793.
The French Revolution caused much fighting and disorder in France. At times, Napoleon was connected to those in power. Other times, he was in jail. He helped the French Republic from those royalist who supported the former king of France. In September 1793, he assumed command of an artillery brigade at the siege of Toulon, where royalist leaders had welcomed a British fleet and enemy troops. The British were driven out in December 17, 1793, and Bonaparte was rewarded with promotion to brigadier general and assigned to the French army in Italy in February 1794.
General Napoleon Bonaparte was later appointed by the republic to repel the royalist on October 5 1795. More than a 1400 royalists died and the rest fled. He had cleared the streets with "a whiff of grapeshot" according to the 19th-century historian Thomas Carlyle. He was then promoted to major general and mark his name on the French Revolution.
The defeat of the Royalist rebelions ended the threat to the Convention and earned Bonaparte sudden fame, wealth, and the patronage of the new Directory. In March 9, 1796, Napoleon married Josephine de Beauharnais,a widow older than him and a very unlikely wife to future ruler.
The campaign in Italy is the first time Napoleon led France to war. Late in March 1796, Bonaparte begins a series of operations to divide and defeat the Austrian and Sardinian armies in Italy. He defeated the Sardinians in April 21, adding Savoy and Nice to territories of France. Then, in a series of brilliant battles, he won Lombardy from the Austrians. Mantua, the last Lombard stronghold fell in February 1797.
In May 1798, General Napoleon left for a campaign in Egypt. The French needed to threaten Britain's empire in India and the French Directory's concerns that Napoleon would take control of France. The French Army under Napoleon won an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Pyramids. Barely 300 French soldiers died, while thousand of Mamluks (an old power in the Middle East) lay dead. But his army is weakened by bubonic plague and poor supplies. The Egyptian campaign was a military failure but a cultural success, the Rosetta Stone was found by a French engineer Captain Pierre-François Bouchard, and French scholar Jean-François Champollion was able to decipher the code in the stone. Napoleon went back to France because of a change in the French government. Some believe that Napoleon should not have left his soldiers in Egypt. Napoleon helped lead the Brumaire coup of November 1799.

Napoleon Bonaparte returned in Paris on October 1799. France's situation had been improved by a series of victories but Republic was bankrupt and the ineffective Directory was unpopular with the French population. He was approached by one of the Directors, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, for his support in a coup to overthrow the constitutional government. The leaders of the plot included his brother Lucien Bonaparte, the speaker of the Council of Five Hundred, Roger Ducos, another Director, Joseph Fouché, and Charles Maurice Talleyrand. The deputies had realised they faced an attempted coup. Faced with their remonstrations, Bonaparte led troops to seize control and disperse them, which left a rump legislature to name Bonaparte, Sièyes, and Ducos as provisional Consuls to administer the government.
Though Sieyès expected to dominate the new regime, he was outmanoeuvred by Bonaparte, who drafted the Constitution of the Year VIII and secured his own election as First Consul. This made Bonaparte the most powerful person in France and he took up residence at the Tuileries.
In 1800, Napoleon assured his power by crossing the Alps and defeating the Austrians at Marengo. He then negotiated a general European peace that established the Rhine River as the eastern border of France. He also concluded an agreement with the pope (the Concordat of 1801), which contributed to French domestic tranquility by ending the quarrel with the Roman Catholic Church that had arisen during the French Revolution.
In France the administration was reorganized, the court system was simplified, and all schools were put under centralized control. French law was standardized in the Napoleonic Code, or civil code, and six other codes. They guaranteed the rights and liberties won in the Revolution, including equality before the law and freedom of religion.
In February 1804, a British-financial plot against Bonaparte was uncovered by the former police minister Joseph Fouche. It gave Napoleon a reason to start a hereditary dynasty. In December 2, 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte crowned himself "Emperor of the French" . People of the French didn't see him as the monarch of the old regime because his holding a Roman position that has the glory related to it. He invited Pope Pius VII to see his coronation at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. During the ceremony, Napoleon I took the crown from the pope's hand and placed it on his own head. This had been agreed on between Napoleon and the Pope before the coronation. At Milan Cathedral on May 26 1805, Napoleon was crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.
To restore prosperity, Napoleon modernizes finance. He regulated the economy to control prices, encourage new industry, and build roads and canals. To ensure well-trained officials and military officers, he promoted a system of public schools under firm government control. He also backed off from some social reforms of the revolution. He made peace with the Catholic Church in the Concordat of 1801. The Concordat kept the Church under state control but recognized religious freedom for Catholics.
Napoleon I won support across class lines. He encourage émigré to return, provided they oath of loyalty. Peasants were relived when he recognized their right to lands they had bought from Church and nobles during the revolution. Napoleon's chief opposition came from royalists and republicans.
Among Napoleon's most lasting reforms was a new law code, popularly called the Napoleonic Code. It embodied Enlightenment principles such as equality of all citizens before the law, religious toleration, and advancement based on virtue. But the Napoleonic Code undid some reforms of the French Revolution. Women, for example, lost most of their newly gained rights under the new code. the law considered women minors who could not exercise the rights of citizenship. Male heads of households regained full authority over their wives and children. Again, Napoleon valued order and authority over individual rights.
Emperor Napoleon abandoned plans to invade England and turned his armies against the Austro-Russian forces, defeating them at the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805. In 1806 Napoleon destroyed the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstädt and the Russian army at Friedland. He crowned his elder brother Joseph Bonaparte as King of Naples and Sicily in 1806 and converted the Dutch Republic into the kingdom of Holland for his brother Louis. Napoleon also established the Confederation of the Rhine (most of the German states) of which he was protector.
To legitimize his rule, he divorced his wife Joséphine and marry Marie Louise, duchess of Parma and daughter of the Emperor Francis I of Austria. Within a year, she delivered a son and heir to the Bonaparte Dynasty. He is named Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte or [[NapoleonWestphalia, under his youngest brother Jerome, the duchy of Warsaw, and others states.
The Congress of Erfurt sought to preserve the Russo-French alliance and the leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. But the relationship is short-lived, in June 23, 1812, Napoleon went to war with Russia. They defeated many Russian cities and villages, but by the time they reached Moscow it was winter.Due to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses. Napoleon's army was unable to defeat the Russians. The Russians began to attack. Napoleon and his army had to go back to France. The French suffered greatly in the course of Napoleon's retreat. He withdrew back into France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers and 40,000 stragglers, against more than three times as many Allied troops. Finally at the Battle of Leipzig, he is defeated by the Allies: Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia.
Napoleon had no choice but to abdicate in favor of his son. However, the Allies refused to accept this. Napoleon abdicated without conditions on April 11, 1814. Before his official abdication, Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill but it didn't work.[needs &#160; proving] In the Treaty of Fontainebleau the victors exiled him to Elba, an island of 12,000 inhabitants in the Mediterranean. The Allies allowed Napoleon to keep an imperial title "Emperor of Elba" and an allowance of 2 million francs a year. Napoleon even requested a 21 gun solute as emperor of the island of Elba. Many delegates feared that Elba was too close to Europe to keep such a dangerous force.
Separated from his son and wife, who had come under Austrian control, cut off from the allowance guaranteed to him by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and aware of rumours he was about to be banished to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean, Napoleon escaped from Elba on February 26 1815. He made a surprise march on March 1, 1815 to Paris. His former troops joined him and Louis XVIII fled to exile. He again became ruler of France for a length of 100 days. Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by the British under Duke of Wellington and Prussians on June 18 1815, which was his last battle. Napoleon was again captured and taken to his second exile on the island of Saint Helena on the Atlantic Ocean.
Napoleon was sent to the island of Saint Helena off the coast of Africa. He died on May 5, 1821 of stomach cancer. Napoleon kept himself informed of the events through The Times and hoped for release in the event that Holland became Prime Minister.There were other plots to rescue Napoleon from captivity including one from Texas, where exiled soldiers from the Grande Armée wanted a resurrection of the Napoleonic Empire in America. There was even a plan to rescue him with a primitive submarine. For Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely and flawed genius. The news that Napoleon had taken up gardening at Longwood also appealed to more domestic British sensibilities.
French people remain proud of Napoleon's glory days. The Napoleonic Code reflects the modern French Constitution. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th century operational mobility underwent significant change. Napoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare. His popularity would later help his nephew Louis-Napoléon to become ruler of France.
On the world stage, Napoleon's conquest spread the ideas of the revolution. He failed to make Europe into a French Empire. Instead, he sparked nationalist feeling across Europe.
