Mother Teresa (born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu IPA: [ˈagnɛs gɔnˈʤa bɔˈjaʤiu]) (August 26, 1910 – September 5, 1997), was a Roman Catholic nun who started the Missionaries of Charity and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work with people. For over forty years, she took care of needs of those without money, those who were sick, those without parents, and those dying of Calcutta (Kolkata), guided in part by the ideals of Saint Francis of Assisi.
As the Missionaries of Charity grew under Mother's leadership, they expanded their ministry to other countries. By the 1970s she had become internationally well known as an advocate for the poor and helpless, due in part to a film and book, Something Beautiful for God by Malcolm Muggeridge. She was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1979.
Following her death she was beatified, which is the first stage of sainthood, by Pope John Paul II and given the title Blessed Teresa of Calcutta.
