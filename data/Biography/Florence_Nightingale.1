Florence Nightingale, OM (May 12, 1820 â€“ August 13, 1910), was a famous English nurse. She helped create the modern techniques of nursing. She helped a lot of wounded soldiers during the Crimean War to get better. She was the first female to receive the Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded to a British person. As a nurse she adopted the name 'The Lady with the Lamp' because at night, she checked on the wounded soldiers and always carried 'The Lamp' with her. Florence Nightingale was a wonderful women who fought the odds of not living a life expected by her family. She helped made modern nursing possible.
Florence Nightingale was born into a very rich, upper class British family in 1820 in Florence, Italy. She was named after the town where she was born. The family moved back to London when Florence was a young girl.
Her parents expected her to become a wife and a mother but in 1845 she decided to become a nurse. While she was training she campaigned for better conditions for poor people in Britain.
In 1854 Florence was working in Harley Street in London when the Crimean war started. She read many reports about the poor treatment of sick and injured soldiers. Shortly afterwards she traveled to Crimea to see for herself. She found the hospitals crowded and dirty.
Florence realised that diseases like cholera were killing more soldiers than injuries were. She used her knowledge of maths and statistics to show the British government that providing better conditions for sick and injured soldiers would help them win the war.
While she was working in Crimea she became known as ``The Lady with the Lamp'' because she would walk around the hospital in the evening carrying a lamp and checking on soldiers.
When she returned she started a school for nurses at St Thomas' hospital in London.
In 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman ever to be awarded the Order of Merit by Queen Victoria.
Florence died in 1910 in London. There are many statues of her in Britain, including one in Waterloo Place in London and a Florence Nightingale museum, also in London. In 2005 the Florence Nightingale museum held an exhibition about Mary Seacole.
