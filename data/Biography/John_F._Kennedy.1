John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 - November 22, 1963), also known as JFK, was the 35th president of the United States of America. He held office from 1961 until he was assassinated (shot dead) in 1963.
Kennedy, a Democrat, beat his Republican party opponent Richard Nixon in the 1960 presidential election. Kennedy was the youngest president ever elected, the only Roman Catholic President and the only president to win a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy was great speaker and inspired a new generation of young Americans.
During the beginning of his term, he approved the CIA's plan to invade Cuba (the Bay Of Pigs invasion). After the invasion failed, the Berlin Wall was built and the Cuban Missile Crisis began. Kennedy ordered millions of ships to surround Cuba and peacefully resolved the Cuban Missile Crisis.
He supported civil rights for African Americans and he supported a large tax cut to help the economy. He also supported something called the New Frontier which was a series of government programs made to help people who were poor. He didn't have a good relationship with Congress, so they did not vote for some of his ideas.
Kennedy was assassinated, or murdered, on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas while he was president. His killer, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested but was shot dead himself two days later, before there was a trial. Because of this and many other reasons there are many conspiracy theories about Kennedy's death.
Kennedy was a very popular president and still is today, ranking highly in public surveys and opinion polls.
