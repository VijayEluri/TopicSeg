William Shakespeare (April, 1564 - April 23, 1616) was an English writer. He wrote plays and also some poetry. Many people consider him to be the greatest English writer of all time and one of the greatest in the world. He wrote plays about history and tragedy and he wrote comedies. His poetry and plays are about being human, with feelings such as love, jealousy, anger, and much more. Children learn about him in schools around the world. Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613.
We do not know much about Shakespeare's life. However, we do know that he was married to Anne Hathaway, a woman five or six years older than he was. He had three children, Susanna Hall, Hamnet Shakespeare and Judith Quiney. By 1592 he had become an actor and was becoming well known as a writer of plays. At his death in 1616, Shakespeare had never published his plays. The plays were collected and published some years after his death. Friends had realized that other people were publishing changed copies of the plays.
There is proof that people in Shakespeare's time thought highly of him. After his death, even his rival Ben Jonson said,
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show,
He was not of an age, but for all time!
About 150 years after Shakespeare died, some writers began to say that the works we call "Shakespeare" were not really written by William Shakespeare. They had various reasons for saying this. For example, the person who wrote "Shakespeare" knew a lot about other countries (especially Italy), but William Shakespeare never left England as far as we know.
Some say that Queen Elizabeth wrote the plays under the false name William Shakespeare.
Several other writers of "Shakespeare" have been suggested, such as Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Most scholars believe that William Shakespeare did write the works that bear his name, but the idea that someone else "wrote Shakespeare" still gets talked about a lot.
