I have been suffering from back pain for years . 
I've tried several treatments prescribed by my doctor , but nothing has had a lasting effect . 
I finally decided to try alternative medicine . 
My friend , Amelia , swore by acupuncture . 
She said that her knee pain went away after only a few weeks of therapy . 
She was skeptical when she first started , but she knew after only a few sessions that it was working for her and that this was no New Age nonsense . 
My co-worker , Ray , suggested that I try some homeopathic treatments . 
He said that taking herbal supplements that are all natural has helped him recover after getting injured on the job a couple of months ago . 
He took these as complementary to the traditional medication his doctor gave him . 
He said that even though the herbs he takes have n't undergone clinical trials , his own experience told him that they work . 
I'm a little nervous about trying these unorthodox treatments , but after hearing about Amelia's and Ray's experiences , I'm willing to give them a try .   Nothing has worked so far , so what do I have to lose ?
