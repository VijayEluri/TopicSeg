Today , we learned what Lucy and her friends did on New Year's Eve ; they went on a New Year's Cruise . 
A cruise , `` cruise , '' is usually a relaxing trip that you take on an ocean , usually for a vacation . 
Here in Los Angeles , you can take a cruise down to Mexico - down to the Baja region of Mexico . 
You can also take a cruise to Hawaii , which will take you a couple of days , and you go on a very large ship . 
Well , this is a cruise not of Hawaii or down to Mexico ; this was just a short cruise that Lucy and her friends went on . 
I , apparently , was not invited , which is a little sad !
Lucy says that her friends and she `` decided to do something a little different this year . 
Instead of going , `` she says , '' to a crowded club or throwing a party on New Year's Eve , `` they '' decided to take a harbor cruise instead .  ``
Normally on New Year's Eve , which is the evening before New Year's - the evening of December 31 st - they go to a club , which would be a dance club - a place to dance to music - or they throw a party . 
Notice the expression to throw , `` throw , '' a party , means to put on a party - to have a party at your house or your apartment . 
But instead of doing those things , they `` decided to take a harbor cruise .  ''
The harbor , `` harbor , '' is an area in the ocean that is next to the land . 
Usually it has walls that are built to protect the boats and the ships . 
So , it's the place where you can think of the boats and ships parking ; it's sort of a parking lot on the water for ships and boats . 
The harbor cruise then was a cruise on a boat around the harbor - around the other boats . 
Usually those are short cruises ; in this case , I believe it was `` four hours long .  ''
The cruise `` included dinner , music , dancing , and a great view of the fireworks .  ''
The fireworks , `` fireworks , '' ( always plural ) are little things that you shoot up into the air and they explode and you see a light . 
Fireworks are very common for many celebrations - big celebrations : the Fourth of July - and in some cities , there are fireworks on New Year's Eve . 
In Los Angeles , there are places that have fireworks on New Year's Eve . 
Lucy says that on the day of New Year's Eve , they `` drove to the marina and were among the first to board the ship .  ''
The marina , `` marina , '' is a harbor that is built especially for smaller boats , and usually there are walkways - sort of wooden sidewalks - to walk out and get on the boat . 
We have a very large marina here in Los Angeles called Marina del Rey - the Marina of the King - and the marina has fireworks , where they have fireworks out over the ocean or near the ocean . 
Lucy says that she and her friends were `` the first to board the ship .  ''
To board , `` board , '' means to get on a ship or an airplane . 
You can also board a train or a bus . 
Anything that carries a lot of people , we say that you board . 
So , if you're at the airport and they say , `` The flight will be boarding in ten minutes , '' that means that people will be getting on the plane in ten minutes . 
So , do n't go and buy some coffee , you may miss your flight - you may not get on the plane in time !
Lucy and her friends boarded the ship . 
She says , `` This was no little boat .  ''
`` This was no '' is another way of saying this was not a little boat . 
This is a somewhat difficult expression , `` this was no .  ''
It's used before an object - a noun - in a sentence without any articles - without any indefinite articles , like `` a '' or `` and '' or definite articles , like `` the .  ''
You can say , `` This was no little boat , '' meaning this was not a little boat . 
But , if you use the word `` a '' or `` the , '' you would have to say , `` not .  ''
`` This was no little boat , '' `` This was not a little boat , '' notice the difference . 
A boat , `` boat , '' is something that floats on the water . 
It stays on top of the water and you can get into it and you can move across the water . 
If it's a very large boat , we often call that a ship , `` ship .  ''
So , Lucy says in the story here that `` This was no little boat . 
It was a large ship with an upper and a lower deck .  ``
The deck , `` deck , '' of a ship is the level - think of it as the floor of the ship , so there could be more than one level - more than one floor . 
We also use that term if you are talking about a bus . 
If the bus is what we would call a double decker that means it has two decks . 
These are , or were , popular in London ; I'm not sure if they still are . 
If you go to London , you can probably find a double decker bus - a bus with two decks . 
The top deck is called the upper deck , and the bottom is called the lower deck . 
Well , this is a large ship . 
`` The crew helped '' Lucy and her friends `` get on board .  ''
The crew , `` crew , '' are the people who work on the boat - the staff of the boat or the ship . 
To help someone get on board means to get inside the boat , or a plane or a train . 
So , they helped them `` get on board '' - they helped them board would be the same meaning - `` and showed us where the life jackets were .  ''
When you go on a ship , they usually have - in fact , they have to have , according to most state laws , some sort of life jacket . 
A life jacket is usually just a vest , not an actual jacket ; it is like a jacket with no sleeves for the arms , and it floats . 
So , in case the boat has a problem and you have to go out into the water , even if you ca n't swim , if you have a life jacket you can still survive - you can still float on top of the water . 
So , they showed Lucy and her friends the life jackets in case there was an emergency . 
`` Even the captain came out to welcome the passengers .  ''
The captain , `` captain , '' is the person who is in charge of - who is the head of the ship ; we call that person the captain . 
So , `` the captain came out , '' meaning he went outside and greeted - said hello to the people who were getting on the boat ; we would call those people the passengers . 
A passenger , `` passenger , '' is anyone who travels on a boat or a ship , an airplane , a train , a bus - any of those things , you can call the people passengers . 
You can even talk about a passenger in a car . 
We often use the term `` the passenger side , '' which in an American car would be on the right side of the car . 
In a car in Great Britain , it would be on the left side . 
Lucy said she and her friends `` had a great time .  ''
They `` did n't get seasick .  ''
To get seasick , `` seasick , '' means to get sick because of the motion of the water . 
The words sea , `` sea , '' is another word for an ocean - it's like an ocean . 
So , seasick is getting sick , usually to your stomach . 
You may even get a little dizzy if you are on the water . 
Lucy jokes that they `` did n't have to call out the Coast Guard , either .  ''
The Coast , `` Coast , '' Guard , `` Guard , '' is part of the United States military . 
They are the people who protect the coasts of the United States , which are the part where the country is next to an ocean ; that would be the coast . 
Here in Los Angeles , we're on the West Coast ; New York City is on the East Coast . 
So , the Coast Guard was not called , meaning they did n't have any emergencies . 
She said that she and her friends `` had so much fun , we did n't want to go back on shore .  ''
To go on shore , `` shore , '' means to leave the boat and go back on land . 
`` Finally , '' Lucy says , `` the captain joked that if '' they `` did n't leave '' the ship , `` he'd make '' them `` walk the plank ! ''
The expression to walk the plank is an old one that you sometimes see in movies about pirates - thieves - people who steal from other ships and boats . 
A plank , `` plank , '' is a long piece of wood . 
In the old days , especially in the movies , if you were somehow caught by the pirates - the thieves - you might be forced to walk out on a long piece of wood and , of course , jump off - you would have to die in the ocean . 
So , the expression here by the captain is a joke , saying well , if you do n't leave , I'll make you walk the plank , just like the pirates did . 
If you've seen the famous movie , `` Pirates of the Caribbean , '' we call it in English , with that really ugly actor - what's his name ?
Johnny Depp , I think he calls himself - then you know what I'm talking about . 
I'm just kidding , of course !
Now let's listen to the story , this time at a native rate of speech .
