We take a trip to the grocery store - the store where you buy food , sometimes called a supermarket , and we are at the checkout stand - the place where you pay . 
To check out , at a grocery store , means to pay for the food that you are buying . 
Our dialogue begins with Yong saying , `` I went to the supermarket to do my weekly shopping . 
The cashiers at this market are usually pretty friendly .  ``
A cashier , `` cashier , '' is the employee - the person who works for the store who takes your money . 
You can recognize the word cash , `` cash '' - which means money - in this word . 
The cashier apparently was `` having a hard day , '' or a difficult day . 
She begins by saying to Yong - the customer - `` Excuse me , sir , this lane is for 15 items or less . 
It looks like you have more than that .  ``
At American grocery stores , there's usually one or two checkout stands - places for you to pay - for those that have ten things or less , or perhaps 15 things or less . 
So , if you're just buying a bottle of Coca-Cola and a pizza , you can go to the , what is sometimes called the express , `` express , '' the express lane . 
A lane , `` lane , '' in this case , is just the line the place where you are standing waiting for the cashier to take your money . 
This cashier is telling the person in the dialogue that they have more than 15 items and they ca n't be in the express lane . 
Yong says , `` No , actually I have exactly 15 , '' actually meaning in fact I have exactly 15 , not 16 , not 14 . 
He also says , `` I have some coupons , too .  ''
A coupon , `` coupon , '' is a small piece of paper , usually from a newspaper or advertisement , that gives you a lower price . 
Sometimes it will be a dollar less or five percent less on one particular food item . 
This , of course , encourages you to buy that type of food . 
The cashier says , `` Just put those down on the belt and push the cart through , please .  ''
She's not very happy . 
She's telling Yong to put those down , meaning put his items - items is just another word for thing - put those things down on the belt , `` belt .  ''
The belt here is a wide piece of rubber or soft plastic that moves in a circle to take the groceries from one end of a checkout stand to the other . 
So , it's like an automatic method of moving the food closer to the cashier so he or she can get the price from it . 
This word , belt , has other meanings in English as well . 
If you look at today's Learning Guide , we talk about so additional meanings of the words belt as well as the word lane , which we just finished explaining . 
The cashier tells Yong to `` push the cart , '' `` cart , '' `` through .  ''
A cart is like a large basket on wheels . 
It's what you put your food in , in a grocery store - in a supermarket - and you push it towards the front - towards the checkout stands , and you take the food out of it and you put it on this belt that takes the food to the cashier . 
Yong says , `` Okay. Can you tell me how much these potatoes are per pound ? ''
Per pound just means for each pound . 
We , in the United States , use pounds as the way of measuring weight . 
The cashier then tells Yong , `` I'll have to do a price check .  ''
A price check , `` check , '' is when the employee has to ask someone else to get the actual price of something for a customer . 
This happens sometimes in supermarkets , and that's what the cashier is doing here . 
She then asks if Yong has `` a club card , '' `` club , '' card , `` card .  ''
This is like a membership card that some grocery stores have . 
In order to shop at the store , you have to have a membership - you have to pay a membership , and usually that gives you lower prices . 
There are other stores that give you a card , and if you use the card , you get a discount . 
You do n't have to pay for the card , but you do get a lower price on some of your food . 
After the cashier asks Yong for his club card , Yong says , `` here it is , '' something you might say when you are giving something to someone else . 
He could also say , `` here you go .  ''
The cashier tells him to `` Swipe it through the machine .  ''
The verb to swipe , `` swipe , '' in this case means to take your credit card and put it through , very quickly , through a little machine that reads your information so that the store can charge your credit card for the amount . 
The verb swipe can also mean to steal , especially if you're talking about something small , like `` I'm going to swipe a pencil from my wife's desk '' - I'm going to steal it . 
I'm sure she's okay with that , though !
The cashier then asks Yong , `` Debit or credit ? ''
These are two different ways of paying for something . 
A credit card is when the bank lends you money for 30 days or for a longer period of time until you pay them back ; that's a credit card . 
A debit card , `` debit , '' is one where you have the money taken out of your bank account right away , so there's no loan involved . 
That is also a popular way of paying for things at stores . 
Yong says that he has a debit card , and asked if he could `` get cash back ? ''
One of the advantages of using a debit card , which takes money directly from your bank , is you can actually ask the cashier in most grocery stores to give you some additional money from your account , just like they were a bank or an automatic teller machine - the machine you get money for automatically when you put in the card . 
Of course , this is more work for the cashier , so she says , `` How much do you want , '' not very nice . 
And he says , `` I'd like 40 dollars .  ''
The cashier then asks him , `` Paper or plastic ? ''
What the cashier is asking here is whether Yong wants paper bags to put the food in or plastic bags . 
Most grocery stores give you the choice of which kind you want . 
Unlike in some countries , most Americans do n't bring a bag with them to put the food in ; they have the store give them the bag . 
Yong asks for paper , and the cashier says , `` Are these tabloids yours , too ? ''
A tabloid , `` tabloid , '' is a kind of newspaper or magazine , usually one that has very shocking or unusual stories . 
Many of these are about famous people - celebrities - and they like to print or have lots of stories in them about Britney Spears and her baby or Angelina Jolie . 
Other famous Hollywood stars are often in these tabloids because people will buy the paper . 
They're very low quality type of newspaper . 
The most famous one in the United States would be `` The National Inquirer .  ''
To inquire means to ask about . 
So , `` The National Inquirer '' is a tabloid that you would find , and they usually have these by the checkout stands in the grocery stores . 
Yong says yes , these `` magazines are mine , '' and the cashier finally says , `` Do you need any help out , '' meaning do you need someone to help you take your food - your groceries - to your car . 
Notice that the cashier does n't say , `` Do you need any help , '' she says , `` Do you need any help out , '' and that's a particular type of verb that we would use in this situation when you're at a store - a grocery store - and the cashier is asking if you need help to take the food to your car . 
Yong says , `` No , I'm fine . 
Thanks .  ``
Now let's listen to the dialogue , this time at a native rate of speech .
