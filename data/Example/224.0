My boss asked me to come up with some holiday promotion ideas so that we can make inroads into the gift-buying market . 
For us to stay competitive , our company has to increase retail sales for this important sales cycle . 
Since we're an online business and not a brick-and-mortar store , we ca n't just put signs in the window or do other types of traditional advertising . 
Lucky for us , though , consumers are increasingly computer savvy and are more likely than ever to buy online . 
That's something we want to capitalize on . 
Like other companies , we're willing to slash prices to attract holiday shoppers . 
We have a large inventory and we do n't have to worry about running out of stock . 
The trick is , how do we increase sales without resorting togimmicks ?  Dressing up salespeople to look like Santa Claus may work for some businesses but not ours . 
I'm just hoping that I can come up with some fresh ideas to jump-start this sales season . 
I know that my boss is counting on me .
