I went to the supermarket to do my weekly shopping .   The cashiers at this market are usually pretty friendly , but this one must have been having a hard day . 
Excuse me , sir , this lane is for 15 items or less .   It looks like you have more than that . 
No , actually I have exactly 15 . 
I have some coupons , too . 
Just put those down on the belt and push the cart through , please . 
Okay .   Can you tell me how much these potatoes are per pound ? 
I'll have to do a price check . 
Do you have a club card ? 
Yes , here it is . 
Swipe it through the machine , sir . 
Debit or credit ? 
Debit .   Could I get cash back ? 
[ sigh ] How much do you want ? 
I'd like $ 40 . 
Paper or plastic ? 
Paper , please .   Are these tabloids yours , too ? 
Uh , yes , those magazines are mine .   Do you need any help out ? 
No , I'm fine .   Thanks .
