Our dialogue in this episode is all about dating , and we have a man , Liam and two different women , Debra and Monica . 
We watch Liam try to get dates with these different women . 
Liam begins by saying , `` I admit it . 
I'm a player .  ``
To admit , `` admit , '' something means to say something is true even if you do n't want to say it . 
It's like confessing something . 
Well , what Liam is confessing here is that he's `` a player .  ''
Player , `` player , '' is an informal expression or informal word that means a man who dates a lot of women , usually at the same time , often without the other women knowing that you are dating more than one woman . 
So , Liam says he's `` a player , '' just like me !
He says , `` I work in an office where there are a lot of attractive women .  ''
Attractive , `` attractive , '' means pretty or good looking . 
He says , `` Take Debra , for example , '' meaning let's start talking about Debra as an example . 
He says , `` I heard that she just broke up with her boyfriend .  ''
To break up with someone means to end a romantic relationship - to stop a romantic relationship . 
This happens here in Hollywood , here in Los Angeles , all the time among celebrities and stars . 
So , to break up with someone means to end your relationship . 
Liam then starts talking to Debra , he says , `` Hi , Debra . 
How's it going ? ``
She says , `` Okay .  ''
What about you - `` How about you ? ''
Liam says he's `` doing okay .  ''
He says he's `` going to an art show '' on Saturday . 
An art show would be a show looking at pictures or paintings . 
Of course , Liam is trying to impress Debra make Debra think that he is a very cultured person . 
He asks Debra if she would like to come with him , and Debra says , `` Geez , I'm pretty busy this weekend .  ''
This is what the women always used to tell me when I asked them out on a date !
The expression geez , `` geez , '' is one we use to express surprise , or perhaps confusion . 
Well , Debra is perhaps a little surprised and she says that she's `` busy this weekend .  ''
Then Liam , who , of course as a player , tries to get women to date him , goes on to say , `` That's too bad . 
How about going for a drink after work today ? ``
To go for a drink means to go have an alcoholic beverage or a soda , maybe a beer , with someone in a bar . 
And Debra says , `` Well , I do n't know , '' and Liam starts to try to convince her ; he says , `` Oh , come on . 
It'll be fun and we can try that new place down the street .  ``
Debra finally says , `` I guess that'll be okay , but just a drink , right , '' meaning they're just going to have a drink , more or less as friends , nothing serious . 
Liam , lying of course , says , `` That's all and I promise I wo n't even try to buy you dinner .  ''
To buy someone dinner - for a man to buy a woman dinner is usually a sign that he wants to date that woman . 
Liam goes on to talk about how asks women out - he asks them to go on a date with him . 
To ask someone out is to ask them to go on a date . 
He says he asks them out whenever he sees them , even ones he's `` never met before .  ''
He then goes on to say that when he's at a restaurant and he sees `` a woman eating by herself , '' he'll say to her , `` Do you mind if I join you , '' meaning is it okay that I sit down with you - will it bother you ?
He says , `` The other day , '' meaning in a recent day - recently , `` I saw a woman at the grocery store and I tried my luck .  ''
To try your luck at something is to do something even if you know it may not be successful - even if you know it may not work . 
To try your luck - you hope you are successful . 
Liam , of course , begins by simply saying , `` Hi '' to this woman . 
The woman , Monica , says , `` Hi , '' and then he , again , probably lying - probably not telling the truth - says , `` I've just moved to this area '' - I've just moved to this part of the city `` and was wondering if you could recommend a good restaurant around here .  ''
Of course , what Liam is doing here , as all men know , is trying to start a conversation and trying to find an excuse to talk to this woman . 
Monica says , `` That depends on what kind of food you like .  ''
The expression that depends on , means that is determined by or that would be influenced by someone or something else . 
So , she's saying here , well , there may be good restaurants , but it depends on the restaurant - the kind of restaurant that you like . 
She then says , `` There's a good Italian restaurant , '' and there's also `` a good Thai place .  ''
Thai , `` Thai , '' refers to Thailand - the country - and Thai food is very popular in many large cities , like Los Angeles . 
Liam says , `` Which one do you prefer ? ''
Which one do you like ?
And Monica says , `` I like them both , but I'd probably go for the Italian place .  ''
To go for , here , means to choose or to select . 
It also has other meanings , this expression , to go for . 
If you look at the Learning Guide , you will see some additional meanings for this expression , but here it means to select . 
Liam , says , `` In that case , would you like to join me for dinner sometime ? ''
Liam is what we would call very smooth . 
To be smooth , `` smooth , '' if you're a man means that you have a certain talent about getting women to go on dates with you , or to say the right thing so they will go on a date with you . 
Monica says , `` I'm not sure . 
I do n't even know you .  ``
Remember , they're at a grocery store . 
Liam says , `` You're right , but you seem really nice and I'd like to get to know you better , '' meaning I'd like to find out more about you . 
`` What do you say ? ''
What do you say here means what do you think - what is your decision ?
Monica says , `` Well , maybe . 
Here's my number . 
Call me and we'll talk about it .  ``
Here's my number means here is my telephone number . 
Liam says , `` I'll do that . 
I'm looking forward to talking to you again .  ``
He ends the story by saying that `` It's as easy as that , '' meaning it's very simple ; you just have to do what he did . 
He says he does n't `` try to be a player . 
All it takes , `` he says all that is necessary - all that you need - '' All it takes is a little charm and a little flattery , and the women will find you irresistible .  ``
A little charm , `` charm , '' means the power to attract other people - to make them feel comfortable . 
If we say about a person , `` He's very charming , '' we mean that other people like him - he has a good way of relating to other people - talking to other people . 
Flattery , `` flattery , '' are words that you use - things that you say to someone else to compliment them - to make them feel good about themselves . 
What Liam is saying here is that if you have a little charm , and if you can give women some flattery , they `` will find you irresistible .  ''
To be irresistible means that it is impossible for them to say no - for someone to deny . 
If a person is irresistible , you mean that the women will have to say yes because they ca n't say no . 
Now let's listen to the dialogue , this time at a native rate of speech .
