I have a day job , but I recently started a small business on the side . 
I did n't know anything about accounting and my friend , Roland , said that he would give me some advice . 
So , the reason that you need to do your bookkeeping is so you can manage your cash flow . 
Even if you have a lot of orders , you may still have problems paying your bills . 
I see what you mean .   Is this the kind of ledger I should be keeping ? 
Yes , definitely . 
You want to list your debits on this side and your credits on this side . 
This will help you figure out important things like your break-even point , your assets and liabilities , your administrative expenses , and whether you're staying within your budget . 
I wish I had an accounts payable department to help me with all this . 
I do n't even know how to create a balance sheet . 
Oh , I have a system .   I keep all my receipts in this bag . 
What would you do if you were audited by the IRS ? 
Do n't even mention the IRS !  I've got enough problems without worrying about them !
