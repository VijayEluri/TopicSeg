Why the long face ? 
I do n't know .   I guess I'm feeling a little homesick . 
I thought you got over that . 
I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but I thought you were coping pretty well . 
I was .   It's just that the holidays are coming up and I wo n't be able to go home because I ca n't afford the airfare . 
I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom's cooking and being around my family . 
Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . 
When I first got here , I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . 
But , you know , I think I was just seeing things through rose-colored glasses . 
What do you mean ?  Well , things back home were n't really that idyllic , but from this distance , all I could think of was the good stuff and none of the bad . 
I see what you mean , but I'm still bummed out . 
I have an idea .   Why do n't we put on our own little holiday celebration ? 
Misery loves company , as they say . 
You know , I could really go for that . 
As long as I do n't have to cook , I'm up for it .
