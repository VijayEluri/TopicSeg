Since our office reorganization , I've been sharing an office with Isabel .   We've been getting on each other's nerves . 
Hey , Isabel , can you cut that out ? 
Cut what out ?  I'm not doing anything . 
You're tapping your pencil on your desk . 
It's driving me crazy . 
Okay , I will if you'll stop slurping your coffee . 
I do n't slurp my coffee . 
And plus , how can you hear it when you're shouting into your phone all the time ? 
You've got to be kidding me ! 
You're complaining about me talking on the phone when your friend Deepak stops by ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
I ca n't stand that guy . 
It's no skin off my nose if you do n't like Deepak . 
Look , we have a lot of pent-up anger from working in these close quarters , and it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while . 
But , it's probably not a good idea to keep it up . 
I'm willing to forgive and forget if you are . 
Fine .   Let's call a truce . 
I'll try to be more considerate and to keep the noise down . 
Yeah , I'll try to do the same .
