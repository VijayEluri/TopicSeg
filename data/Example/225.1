This episode is called `` Feeling Homesick , '' `` homesick '' ( one word ) .
To feel or to be homesick means to miss your place where you would normally live . 
If you move to another place or you are traveling , you may still want to go back to your old house and your old friends and your family ; this is to be homesick , when someone misses their home , either because they have moved or because they are taking a vacation or a trip somewhere . 
Annie says to Luis , `` Why the long face ? ''
This is short for why do you have a long face . 
When we say someone has a long , `` long , '' face , we mean that they're sad - that they're not happy . 
Luis says , `` I do n't know . 
I guess I'm feeling a little homesick .  ``
Annie says , `` I thought you got over that , '' meaning I thought that this was no longer a problem for you . 
`` I know the adjustment was hard when you first '' moved here . 
Adjustment , `` adjustment , '' means to adapt or to change to your new place - your new environment . 
So , she's saying I thought that although you had a difficult adjustment - it took you some time to get used to this new place - that you were over that - that you no longer had a problem with that . 
She says , `` I thought you were coping pretty well .  ''
To cope , `` cope , '' means to manage or to deal with a difficult situation . 
`` I ca n't cope , '' that would be something you would say when you feel as though the situation is too difficult . 
When my 24 nieces and nephews come and visit me , I ca n't cope . 
There's too much noise - too many of them . 
Yes , I actually do have 24 nieces and nephews !
Well , Annie says that Luis is not coping very well . 
Luis says that he was coping well , `` It's just that the holidays are coming up and I wo n't be able to go home , '' he says . 
It's just that means the only reason that he is feeling this way is because the holidays - Christmas or Chanukah or some other holiday - is coming up and he `` wo n't be able to go home .  ''
When we say something is coming up , we mean it is coming close in time . 
If today is Monday , Wednesday is coming up - it's close in time . 
Luis says that he cannot `` afford the airfare , '' meaning he does n't have money for the airfare . 
To afford , `` afford , '' means to have enough money to do something . 
Luis says that he's `` longing for some of the comforts of home .  ''
To long for something , as a verb , means to want something very badly - to strongly want something . 
The comforts of home is an expression that refers to the things that you like that are in your house or that are in your home . 
In general , comforts ( usually plural ) means the good things in life - the things that make your life pleasant . 
Annie says that yes , it can be `` pretty lonely over the holidays .  ''
Lonely , `` lonely , '' means to not be with other people - to be sad because you are by yourself ; you do not have other friends or family near you . 
Notice that she uses the expression `` over the holidays , '' we use that to mean during the time of the holidays . 
Annie says that when she first got to the city where they live , she would `` get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded '' her of home . 
To be depressed means to be very sad . 
Sometimes , you do n't even know why you're sad ; sometimes you do . 
If you come home and there's no food your refrigerator and you're hungry , you could get very sad - very depressed . 
This happens to me almost every day !
To be nostalgic , nostalgic , `` means to think about something in the past , and to be a little sad remembering someone or someplace in the past that is part of happy memory . 
So , it was happy back then , and you're thinking back on that particular time or place or person , and you feel a little sad because you miss that person . 
You would like to have those happy times again . 
Annie goes on to say that she thinks she was `` just seeing things through rosecolored glasses .  ''
To see something through rose , `` rose , '' ( hyphen ) colored glasses means to think something is better , or to see something as being better than it really is . 
So , you're being too optimistic ; you're thinking things are better , but the reality is in real life , they're not as good as you think they are . 
Luis asks Annie what she means , and she says that `` things back home , '' meaning in the place where she grew up - where her family is , things were not `` really that idyllic , '' `` idyllic .  ''
To be idyllic means to be perfect , without any problems . 
To be peaceful , that would be idyllic . 
A vacation in Hawaii on the beach , for me , that would be idyllic ; the perfect thing . 
In fact , I think I need a vacation , do n't you ?
Let's all meet in Honolulu , Hawaii over the holidays . 
I'll see you there !
Luis says , `` I see what you mean , '' meaning I understand you , `` but I'm still bummed out .  ''
To be bummed , `` bummed , '' or to be bummed out , either one is possible , means to be disappointed - to be depressed - to be sad . 
Someone could say , `` I'm really bummed about the game today '' - I'm really sad about what happened . 
Annie then has an idea ; she suggests that they have their own holiday celebration . 
They can all go over to her house - she and her friends and Luis and anyone else who is `` on their own this time of year .  ''
To be on your own means to be alone or by yourself . 
She says , `` Misery loves company .  ''
This is an old expression . 
Misery , `` misery , '' means something that is sad - something that causes you to be sad . 
So , `` Misery loves company , '' here company means other people ; it does n't mean a business . 
The word company can also mean other people . 
You may say , `` I ca n't talk to you right now on the phone , I have company , '' meaning I have people visiting me - people - other people who are here . 
So , misery loves company means people who are sad like other people who are sad - want to be with them . 
Luis says that he `` could really go for '' Annie's idea , meaning he really likes it . 
She says that it would not be a lot of trouble because she is `` up for it .  ''
To be up for something means to be willing to do something . 
Someone may say to you `` Hey , let's go to Honolulu with Jeff McQuillan and everyone who listens to the ESL Podcast for the holidays , '' and you say , `` Sure , I'm up for it , '' meaning yes , I am willing to do that . 
Well , back to the real world here . 
Luis and Annie say that they're going to get together , and that's the happy end to our story . 
Now let's listen to the dialogue again , this time read at a normal speed .
