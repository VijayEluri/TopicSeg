This episode is called `` Alternative Medicine .  ''
The word alternative means different or choosing a different kind of something . 
Someone may say , `` What are my alternatives , '' meaning what are my choices . 
Here , alternate medicine means a different kind of medicine . 
It might also be called nontraditional medicine . 
The story begins by me saying that I have suffered `` from back pain for years . 
I've tried several treatments prescribed by my doctor .  ``
To prescribe , `` prescribe , '' is to give a patient - a doctor giving a patient some medicine to take . 
You are prescribed , by your doctor , certain medicines . 
These are things that the doctor says you should do . 
Normally , when we say something is prescribed , or that it is a prescription drug , we mean that you can only get those drugs or those types of medicine from a doctor - from a medical doctor , not from an applied linguistics doctor . 
I ca n't give you any drugs . 
I can give you something better than drugs : ESLPodcast !
The story continues that although I've tried these different medicines , `` nothing has had a lasting effect .  ''
Lasting , `` lasting , '' means permanent or continuing for a long time . 
We sometimes say , `` long-lasting , '' which means the same - something that will be continuing for a long period of time . 
The word lasting has another meaning , and we talk about the other meanings of that word in our Learning Guide for this episode . 
The story continues by saying that `` I finally decided to try alternative medicine . 
My friend , Amelia , swore by acupuncture .  ``
To swear , `` swear , '' by something means to trust in something - to believe in something or to rely on something . 
`` I swear by these pills '' - `` I swear by this drug .  ''
What I'm saying is I believe in it - I think it is good - I think it is useful . 
To swear can also mean to say some vulgar words . 
I wo n't do any here on the episode , but that's one meaning of swear . 
To swear also means to say that you believe in something or to say that something is true , and that's the meaning that we're using here . 
`` My friend , Amelia , swore by '' - swore is the past tense of swear , `` swore '' - she `` swore by acupuncture .  ''
Acupuncture , `` acupuncture , '' is when the person , who we would call an acupuncturist , uses little pins - little needles - and sticks them in your body . 
This is a nontraditional kind of medicine . 
I have never had acupuncture ; I do n't like needles . 
The story says that my friend Amelia told me that `` her knee pain went away after only a few weeks of therapy .  ''
Therapy , `` therapy , '' is a set of things or a kind of treatment that you have to reduce your pain or to make you feel better . 
You can have therapy that is physical ; you can have therapy that is using drugs ; you can also have psychological therapy . 
When somebody says , `` I'm in therapy , '' they mean that they are going to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist to help them feel better . 
Here , the word therapy is used to mean the physical or the drugs that this particular patient is getting . 
In this case , the therapy is acupuncture . 
My friend says that `` She was skeptical when she first started .  ''
To be skeptical , `` skeptical , '' means to doubt - to question - to not believe something . 
`` I'm skeptical about men from Mars visiting our planet and building the pyramids of Egypt '' - I do n't believe that's true - I find it difficult to believe . 
Actually , I think they came from Mercury , not Mars !
The story goes on that my friend was getting better `` after only a few sessions .  ''
A session would be the time that she went into see the acupuncturist - her treatments . 
She realized that acupuncture `` was no New Age nonsense .  ''
New Age , `` New Age , '' is related to a belief - an idea - almost a religious idea about healing and health and spirituality that is used to help make people feel better . 
It's sort of like an alternative religion versus traditional religion , that's New Age . 
When we use it in the United States , usually it is a negative term . 
Someone says , `` Oh , that's too New Age for me , '' they mean that it is not something that they believe in - they're skeptical about it - they think it's nonsense - not true . 
Now , of course , I'm not saying whether these things are true or not ; I'm just presenting my story here - a story . 
Actually , not my story ; my back does n't hurt . 
My shoulder hurts , but not my back . 
Getting back to the story , `` My co-worker , Ray , suggested that I try some homeopathic treatments .  ''
Homeopathic , `` homeopathic , '' is a kind of medicine , again , an alternative kind of medicine that uses small amounts of something to treat an illness . 
The belief , I think , is that you do n't want a lot of a drug or a lot of some chemical or some herb , you want only just a little bit to help treat the person - to make the person better . 
`` My co-worker , Ray , '' said that he was `` taking herbal supplements that are all natural .  ''
Herbal , `` herbal , '' notice we do n't normally pronounced the `` h .  ''
It is possible to say herbal , but most people say herbal . 
The word herbal comes from herbs , `` herb , '' or `` herbs , '' ( plural ) which are plants , and they are plants that you can make food out of ; sometimes they are plants that you make medicine out of . 
Well , these are plants that you make medicine out of . 
They're called supplements , `` supplements , '' because they're additional . 
The word supplement means to add something additional - in addition to the normal or regular treatment that you may be receiving for your pain or your injury . 
So , he's taking these herbal supplements , probably tea or some sort of pill that he takes . 
He says that they're `` all natural .  ''
When we say something is all natural , we mean that there are n't any man made or human made chemicals - no artificial ingredients . 
Artificial is the opposite of natural . 
My friend , or rather , my co-worker , Ray , got `` injured on the job a couple of months ago .  ''
To be injured , `` injured , '' just means to be hurt - to have some problem with some part of your body : your arm , your leg , your knee , and so forth . 
Ray took these herbal supplements `` as complementary to traditional medication '' that `` his doctor gave him .  ''
To take something complementarily or as complementary means to take it in addition to . 
When we say something complements something else , `` complement , '' we mean that it matches - that it goes with something else . 
There's also a word complimentary , spelled with an `` i , '' which means to say something nice about someone . 
These are drugs he's taking in addition to - to complement - his `` traditional medication .  ''
Medication is another word for the drugs that he is taking . 
He says that `` even though the herbs '' have not `` undergone clinical trials , his experience '' tells him that they are working . 
To undergo means to experience or participate in . 
Clinical trials are scientific tests that medical researchers do , usually , to make sure the drug actually works . 
I end my story by saying that `` I'm a little nervous about trying these unorthodox treatments .  ''
Unorthodox , `` unorthodox , '' is the opposite of orthodox , which means traditional . 
So , unorthodox would be nontraditional or alternative kinds of treatments . 
`` After hearing about '' my friend's and co-worker's `` experiences , '' I say , `` I'm willing to give them a try . 
Nothing has worked `` for me '' so far `` - nothing has helped me so far , '' so what do I have to lose ? ``
That expression , what do I have to lose , means it ca n't hurt and it might help . 
Now let's listen to the story , this time at a normal speed .
