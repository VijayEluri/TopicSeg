My friends and I decided to do something a little different this year . 
Instead of going to a crowded club or throwing a party on New Year's Eve , we decided to take a harbor cruise instead . 
The cruise would be four hours long , and it included dinner , music , dancing , and a great view of the fireworks . 
On that day , we drove to the marina and we were among the first to board the ship . 
This was no little boat .   It was a large ship with an upper and a lower deck . 
The crew helped us get on board and showed us where the life jackets were in case of an emergency . 
Even the captain came out to welcome the passengers . 
We had a great time . 
I did n't get seasick as I'd feared , and we did n't have to call out the Coast Guard , either . 
We had so much fun , we did n't want to go back on shore . 
Finally , the captain joked that if we did n't leave , he'd make us walk the plank !
